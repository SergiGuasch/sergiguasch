You will use the free tier of the Open Weather Map API. The resulting weather data includes:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>temperature</li>\\n<li>sunrise and sunset time</li>\\n<li>&#8220;feels like&#8221; temperature</li>\\n<li>pressure</li>\\n<li>humidity</li>\\n<li>wind speed</li>\\n<li>cloudiness</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>All the above data points are returned hourly for the next 48 hours in JSON format for free.</p>\\n<p><img width=\"1486\" height=\"636\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-421 size-full\" src=\"https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pasted-into-Using-the-Open-Weather-Map-API-with-Python-3.png\" srcset=\"https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pasted-into-Using-the-Open-Weather-Map-API-with-Python-3.png 1486w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pasted-into-Using-the-Open-Weather-Map-API-with-Python-3-300x128.png 300w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pasted-into-Using-the-Open-Weather-Map-API-with-Python-3-1024x438.png 1024w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pasted-into-Using-the-Open-Weather-Map-API-with-Python-3-768x329.png 768w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pasted-into-Using-the-Open-Weather-Map-API-with-Python-3-700x300.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1486px) 100vw, 1486px\" /></p>\\n<p>We will use Python to query the API without using any dependencies except for the <code>requests</code> and <code>json</code> packages so you can easily adapt it to suit your particular needs. Let&#8217;s get started!</p>\\n<p><span id=\"more-417\"></span></p>\\n<h3>Obtaining an API Key</h3>\\n<p>Go to the Open Weather Map website and register (for free): <a href=\"https://openweathermap.org/\">https://openweathermap.org/</a></p>\\n<p>Once logged in, go to <a href=\"https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys\">API Keys</a> in order to copy your API key.</p>\\n<p>To verify it works, run the following code (replacing your API key with the placeholder):</p>\\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"python\">import requests\\r\\nimport json\\r\\n\\r\\napi_key = \"0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef\"\\r\\nlat = \"48.208176\"\\r\\nlon = \"16.373819\"\\r\\nurl = \"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat=%s&amp;lon=%s&amp;appid=%s&amp;units=metric\" % (lat, lon, api_key)\\r\\n\\r\\nresponse = requests.get(url)\\r\\ndata = json.loads(response.text)\\r\\nprint(data)</pre>\\n<p>If you receive an error 401, this probably means that their backend has not yet activated your API key (in my case, this took almost half an hour).</p>\\n<p>You can also use <a href=\"https://www.postman.com/\">Postman</a> instead of Python to explore the API more interactively:</p>\\n<figure id=\"attachment_420\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-420\" style=\"width: 2716px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pasted-into-Using-the-Open-Weather-Map-API-with-Python-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-420 size-full\" src=\"https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pasted-into-Using-the-Open-Weather-Map-API-with-Python-2.png\" alt=\"Sending the Request using Postman\" width=\"2716\" height=\"1588\" srcset=\"https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pasted-into-Using-the-Open-Weather-Map-API-with-Python-2.png 2716w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pasted-into-Using-the-Open-Weather-Map-API-with-Python-2-300x175.png 300w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pasted-into-Using-the-Open-Weather-Map-API-with-Python-2-1024x599.png 1024w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pasted-into-Using-the-Open-Weather-Map-API-with-Python-2-768x449.png 768w, https://knasmueller.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pasted-into-Using-the-Open-Weather-Map-API-with-Python-2-700x409.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2716px) 100vw, 2716px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-420\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sending the Request using Postman</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Mind that you need to provide coordinates (latitude and longitude) for your request &#8211; there are many free services such as <a href=\"https://www.latlong.net/\">latlong.net</a> where you can convert a specific place to those coordinates. In my opinion, this is an advantage compared to using city names since coordinates are less ambiguous.</p>\\n<p>Also, I added <code>units=metric</code> to receive the temperature in degrees Celsius &#8211; depending on where you live, you might want to use <code>imperial</code> instead.</p>\\n<h3>Current temperature</h3>\\n<p>To extract the current temperature from the above call, simply access the JSON result:</p>\\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"python\">current = data[\"current\"][\"dt\"]\\r\\nprint(current)\\r\\n# 5.25</pre>\\n<h3>Hourly Forecast</h3>\\n<p>The hourly forecast is stored under the key <code>hourly</code> &#8211; it is easy to iterate over the result set and extract the hour and temperature for each entry:</p>\\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"python\">hourly = data[\"hourly\"]\\r\\n\\r\\nfor entry in hourly:\\r\\n    dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(entry[\"dt\"], pytz.timezone(\\'Europe/Vienna\\'))\\r\\n    temp = entry[\"temp\"]</pre>\\n<p>In the code above, I converted the UNIX timestamp given by the API into a <code>datetime</code> object in my timezone, but feel free to use your favourite method to obtain a readable date.</p>\\n<h3>Wrap Up</h3>\\n<p>The Open Weather API has proven to be very reliable and flexible in the project I was working on. Since no external dependencies are involved, this is a very simple and simultaneously flexible approach for obtaining weather data in Python.</p>\\n<p>Mind that currently, the free plan is limited to 1000 calls per day so it makes sense to cache the response at least for one hour per place to avoid hitting that limit.</p>\\n<p>Let me know if you have any questions or leave a comment if this was helpful. Thanks for reading!</p>\\n<h3>Appendix &#8211; API Result Data Format</h3>\\n<p>The API call used above returns JSON data in the following format (shortened):</p>\\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\"
