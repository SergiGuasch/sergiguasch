Some goverments use that data to train models in order to develope techniques for military or surveillance purposes. This is ethically reprehensible, so in this case, this ethical problem it becomes a political problem when the goverments are involved. So, in order to use computer vision and facial recognition ethically and responsibly the goverments should create by law some procedures to put all these techniques under government regulations, and institutional reviews.
