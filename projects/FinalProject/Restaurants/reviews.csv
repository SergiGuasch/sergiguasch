5,7-02-2022 ,"I’d seen the reviews online and had a friend recommendation to try here and I’m glad I did! The garlic prawns with tomato bread were the best! I also had some ham/cheese tapas, a beer and finished with some churos. It was 25 euros so well worth it. Would definitely go back!

13,11-12-2021 ,"I was recommended this place for Tapas during TripAdvisor search. They don't do reservations but there is a waiting list outside. First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.",0.21119242424242426,0.45358030303030306

36,28-08-2021 ,"This place has everything going for it. It has a good location, a buzz about it, and clearly has excellent word of mouth. We came a few years ago, and have just returned this weekend. Over the years we have recommended it to many people.You go outside, put your name on the list, get told your waiting time, and come back after having had a drink elsewhere. Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed.

I was so surprised with his answer, so I requested to please speak with the manager. We found out he waa the manager.

How on earth can a restaurant like this have 4,5 with over 12 000 ratings. That is a mystery for me. The service was really a disgrace and the food was OK, nothing more. We were given a menu that was printed out on a paper and the printing black ink was faded on the menu so we couldn't read all of the menu and we couldn't see the prizes. When I told the waiter this he just showed me that all the menus were like that. Hahaha!And the dishes on the menu had no description so you had no idea what some of the stuff was or any sort of detail to it. There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: ""No worries"".One of the dishes said something like ""tacos beef"" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a ""sorry"" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it. We went away both hungry and just laughing at the entire experience. This was definitely our first and last time here.Spare your money and go to other restaurants that a actually great - there are plenty of them in Barcelona. ",0.10833333333333332,0.5135416666666667

So Very Uncool. Especially that they didnt even try to find us other solution.Positiv: -8pm we could get a table without waiting-2 delicious tapas: sirloin and potatoes with eggs (all other tapas we took was maximum average quality)I was expected much better from this many positive feedbacks but I wouldnt come back here to eat.

53,6-09-2020 ,"I have been going to this restaurant ever since I arrived in Barcelona 2 years ago and have recommended it to many of my colleagues and friends. However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me ""no me hablas en ingles"", ""no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español"". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated.

In the begining the waiters were already rude, but as we were there for a nice time with Friends, we didnt want to make a big thing from that. But the episodes started to occur, for instance, when one of the waiters complained because we were not ordering all the things for once (we were in a group of 11 and we were eating tapas, so no way everybody would order at the same time). When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling. At this time we couldnt stand the situation anymore and stood up to leave.

123,15-12-2019 ,"This is quite the famous place. Since we've planned on a big dinner, we only wanted to order a Tapa or two. Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese & Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.",0.31627906976744186,0.5517441860465115
124,14-12-2019 ,i think this restaurant is better than we experienced. How? One waitress can change everything.

129,9-12-2019 ,"Here in Barcelona on business and decided to grab a solo dinner and explore the city a bit. Stumbled upon this restaurant that had people spilling out the door. Good that I was solo because the helpful hostess and servers at the bar got me seated immediately and I was so glad because I was able to meet Ruel, William, Jordi and a younger, cute fellow who had nickname but I can’t recall if they told me his real name. Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable. Overall the food was great, the Sangria top notch but it was the service that really sold me on the tapas place. I really hope I have some time to stop by again before my trip ends but I will be sure to come back the next time in Barcelona!",0.22083333333333335,0.4413194444444445

131,2-12-2019 ,"Had lunch at this restaurant because of the rave reviews and location. HOWEVER, this is a tourist trap, with the worst service ever. First of all, the server acted like he didn't even want to be here. Second of all, he had ZERO knowledge about hygiene and food safety. When he brought out the first tapa ( mushrooms w egg yolk ), his thumb was touching the rim of the plate and nail was touching the mushroom. By the third tapa, he looked at me as his thumb touched the tomato bread. And he handed me a new plate with grease on it. Thinking about all the germs he had in his nails...

140,16-11-2019 ,"This tapas restaurant was recommended by an employee at the hotel who knew we wanted somewhere nearby. Thursday evening around six we were able to get a table immediately. Our server, Raquel, was very helpful explaining the differences between the tapas and mondtiditos. We ordered several items including sardines, crispy eggplant, mushrooms with asparagus codfish fritters and enjoyed everything. Two nites later we returned and Raquel remembered us. This time we tried garlic shrimp and a fried platter of squid, sardines and cuttlefish with mini poblanos plus a couple of “old favorites and a pitcher of sangria. Second dinner was even better and we then took Raquel’s dessert recommendation of bread pudding which is more of a soufflé with a creamy interior—scrumptious! Prices are very reasonable, service is quick and they are open from 9:30am to 1:30 am. If we return to Barcelona, we will return to Catalana",0.25152777777777774,0.38375000000000004
