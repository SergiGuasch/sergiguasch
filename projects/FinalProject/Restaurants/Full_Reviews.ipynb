First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.</td>\n",

Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!</td>\n",

How on earth can a restaurant like this have 4,5 with over 12 000 ratings. That is a mystery for me. The service was really a disgrace and the food was OK, nothing more.

When I told the waiter this he just showed me that all the menus were like that.

There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it.

However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated.

I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling.

Therefore went inside and was told off by the queue lady because we were standing on the wrong side of where we were supposed to be. Brushed that off as them being flustered due to the high number of customers but a bit of signage to let customers know where to queue would be helpful (and perhaps a little more service training for the queue lady would be awesome)Got in the queue, was told 30-45 mins. As there were a few customers in front that left, we promptly got a table. The waitress we had was patient and helpful with our orders. Food came out pretty quickly although there were some pretty hefty gaps between some orders (10-15 mins??)We tried re-ordering from a tall man with glasses but was told to “wait” and he never came back. He was constantly shaking his head at other customers after taking their orders so we took our next order with another server. Service was pretty patchy depending on which moody (or happy) person you got.

Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese &amp; Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason.

Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable.

Our server, Raquel, was very helpful explaining the differences between the tapas and mondtiditos. We ordered several items including sardines, crispy eggplant, mushrooms with asparagus codfish fritters and enjoyed everything. Two nites later we returned and Raquel remembered us. This time we tried garlic shrimp and a fried platter of squid, sardines and cuttlefish with mini poblanos plus a couple of “old favorites and a pitcher of sangria. Second dinner was even better and we then took Raquel’s dessert recommendation of bread pudding which is more of a soufflé with a creamy interior—scrumptious! Prices are very reasonable, service is quick and they are open from 9:30am to 1:30 am. If we return to Barcelona, we will return to Catalana</td>\n",

When we left at 9:30, the line was out the door. They have a regular menu and a specials menu. A couple of dishes we wanted from the specials menu were already sold out. We loved the razor clams, the burrata salad and the ham and cheese mini sandwich the best, but everything we tried was good. Make sure to save room for the burnt St Joan bread pudding.

The garlic prawns with tomato bread were the best! I also had some ham/cheese tapas, a beer and finished with some churos. It was 25 euros so well worth it. Would definitely go back! The inside is more bright and modern than I was expecting but it had a nice atmosphere and great food.  \n",

High quality small dishes, with a very wide offer. It is always full, you need to queue. Go with plenty of time. The atmosphere is great, service is fast and prices are reasonable. You can have a taste of the local cuisine with several small dishes. You will not go there only once.  \n",

Very good place with quality food and very good treatment by the waiters. For dessert I ordered the crema catalana and it is the best I've ever tasted, it was only 2.95 euros, amazing!  \n",

Food comes very quickly, best to not order too much at the same time. Staff is friendly, however can appear a bit rushed as this place seems to have a waiting line outside most of the time. But really a must-try!  \n",

Me and my friend ordered a lot of things and we pay a very reasonable price. The service is also very good. I recommend it 100%.  \n",

We went back again to this restaurant a few days later and also one of it's sister restaurant Vinitus. :)  \n",

       "13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I was recommended this place for Tapas during TripAdvisor search. They don't do reservations but there is a waiting list outside. First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.  \n",

I went at the end of November with a colleague and they expanded the restaurant but the quality is still the same: Excellent!  \n",

They were very disorganized and look lost and desperate while taking care the long waiting line.The food is good but you can find other places better than this one in barcelona. I hope they can improve their service because the place is very nice.  \n",

The is absolutely the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona. The food is fantastic, the drinks and wine very good, and the overall experience is definitely value-for-money. The staff is very friendly and service minded. Its not possible to book a table, so I recommend come early or be prepared to wait for a while to be seated. Great Experience!  \n",

After all the waiting the waiter started to tell us off. What? Definitely not recommended. The system of listing people outside is a mess. They don’t do reservations and everyone is packed in the front of the restaurant. And the employees tell you off. Poor service.  \n",

IT WAS THAT GOOD. The front-of-house was really friendly and accommodating. There was a long line-up or queue but it was worth it! Raquel was our server and she was the best! She recommended a lot of their popular tapas, and they did not disappoint at all! It was so so good! The seafood was fresh and properly cooked, we had grilled figs that was so fresh, and mushrooms with egg yolk. It was all divine. Everything was served nice and hot. The garlic shrimp, galician clams, grilled cuttlefish, and many more, are definitely what to order. The staff was absolutely friendly.  \n",

We had a big table, they made us leave because someone else was coming. But in the same time they did not let us book a table earlier.   \n",

The food was fantastic - great quality, freshly cooked and quickly served. We had been told about this place by friends who had been before and it didn’t disappoint!You can’t book but you turn up and leave your name and they tell you roughly how long until your table is ready, so you can nip off for a drink nearby then come back, which is what we did. Our table was called promptly when we came back so we didn’t have to wait. It is always very busy so make sure you are there when your name is called as I would imagine they don’t hold tables for long!The service was impeccable and very quick. The place is very buzzing and full of atmosphere, so it was great fun - but not the place for a quiet, leisurely meal.

Each time we think of the city, this restaurant comes to mind first. The food is excellent and the best service.The staff are very nice. Price is reasonable. Yes, the line is often long but it's worth the wait. If/when we go back to Barcelona and this restaurant is the first stop!!  \n",

We waited about 25 minutes for a table at around 8.30pm on a Sunday evening. The staff were friendly, the restaurant was spotlessly clean and the food was excellent. The two of us shared some red prawns, razor clams, some beef and some whitebait, followed by a kind of bread pudding and churros, plus a jug of sangria. Everything was excellent.   \n",

What a fantastic find. Hugely popular, with quite a queue, but very well worth the wait. The razor clams were fabulous, as was the anchovy montadito, the croquettes, the burnt Sant Teresa torrija and the house chardonnay. Very reasonably priced. Sherwin (waiter) was excellent.  \n",

I ate around 13:30, so it may have been slow and too early, but everything just seemed slow and mediocre in the restaurant.I ordered 4 different types of tapas, and only liked 1 of the items.It's a very tourist-recommended location, but I'd suggest trying other local restaurants.  \n",

The Maitre d Rachez wasan incredible host. She made you feel great even if their was a wait. The food was incredible. We had multiple Shrimp types, Potatas Bravas, beef tenderloin, mini burgers, calamari, fist, etc. The sangria was to die for. One thing to note was that there were 3 other girls who waited on us - Cherry, Elsie, and Vangie. When the were not running plates, they were busy getting the place in order (moving plates, cleaning up, etc.) Thank you Girls - You run that joint. Overall, we loved it here and would go back again and again.  \n",

It has a good location, a buzz about it, and clearly has excellent word of mouth. We came a few years ago, and have just returned this weekend. Over the years we have recommended it to many people.You go outside, put your name on the list, get told your waiting time, and come back after having had a drink elsewhere. Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!  \n",

I want to share my disappointment with this place. They have bad service and terrible food. We ordered several tapas, but the waitress decided he was not going to place all the order. When we asked why he didn't bring all the order out he said then that we don't live in SLAVE time anymore. I was so surprised with his answer, so I requested to please speak with the manager. We found out he waa the manager. He moved on with screaming, yelling and behaving as a terrible person and forgot his service job. We left that place and will NEVER return. Don't waste your time and money place, find instead the other better tapas places in Barcelona.  \n",

It was our first time trying tapas and we weren’t sure what to order so the waiter ordered for us. All of his suggestions were finger-licking good, the dessert too! Will definitely be coming back more often.  \n",

Some of the dishes change daily, but we thought they were all great (some pictures attached). Our particular favourite was the cabreaos eggs (spicy eggs), which is a bit of a play on eggs and chips ( and like 6 euro !)We tried most of the menu, and particularly loved all the seafood (and the tomato bread !) We will DEFINITELY be coming back here when we return to Barcelona!  \n",

Expunge for the quality we’ve received. Also we ordered a dish saying salat included and it arrived without it.

The place is generally crowded and there is a long waiting line (I went a week ago and tables were very spaced out, more relaxed and we were admitted quickly, these changes are due to covid) despite this, IT IS AMAZING and very, very, very worth it. The food is beyond incredible and dinning is an experience, fast paced and with many tapas ordered, it is fun, enjoyable and very exciting. I will never stop recommending it for locals or tourists. I have heard immaculate reviews from others. Definitely go if you have the oportunity :)  \n",

This is the first time that I'm really suspicious to a rating on TripAdvisor. How on earth can a restaurant like this have 4,5 with over 12 000 ratings. That is a mystery for me. The service was really a disgrace and the food was OK, nothing more. We were given a menu that was printed out on a paper and the printing black ink was faded on the menu so we couldn't read all of the menu and we couldn't see the prizes. When I told the waiter this he just showed me that all the menus were like that. Hahaha!And the dishes on the menu had no description so you had no idea what some of the stuff was or any sort of detail to it. There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it. We went away both hungry and just laughing at the entire experience. This was definitely our first and last time here.Spare your money and go to other restaurants that a actually great - there are plenty of them in Barcelona.   \n",

So Very Uncool. Especially that they didnt even try to find us other solution.Positiv: -8pm we could get a table without waiting-2 delicious tapas: sirloin and potatoes with eggs (all other tapas we took was maximum average quality)I was expected much better from this many positive feedbacks but I wouldnt come back here to eat. It would have been nicer in a smaller bar or restaurant where they care about the costumers.  \n",

Great service, fast. I recommend to visit and try catalan cream, tomato bread, all tapas.  \n",

We ended up here for breakfast every day! Great, simple breakfast menu with fantastically reasonable prices! We had lunch here one day too but for us breakfast stole the show! Always busy so be prepared to wait a bit but it was worth it for us!  \n",

But if you don't present full they won't let you sit on the table.Totally absence of Customer centricity.I have already arranged a business meeting in that place otherwise I would spare my money there   \n",

Always a pleasure! Great local food, always fresh, always tasty. Each time we've tried something else in the menu.This time we've set on the bar and had a great \"closer\" service experience as well.Until next time....  \n",
       "53   I have been going to this restaurant ever since I arrived in Barcelona 2 years ago and have recommended it to many of my colleagues and friends. However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET ROBBED WHILE ENJOYING YOUR MEAL AND THEN TREATED LIKE YOU ARE A THIEF AND TOLD YOU MUST NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU PAY THEN GO AHEAD AND EAT HERE.  \n",

I visited this place for the first time 8 years ago and now the plates are much smaller and the prices much higher, so I was a bit dissapointed during my second visit :/  \n",

When he stopped because he couldn’t walk more (just for a minute or some seconds) they couldn’t stop telling me rudely to move him out of the way because he was “bothering”. I understand they need to walk fast without obstacles and everything, but he was just laying down and annoying nobody. Unless they can cure him I can’t do anything else apart from waiting, but it’s not necessary to be so rude for just a sick dog that can’t move and needs to rest.Never gonna eat there ever again.  \n",

Exactly what I was expecting from a local tapas place. Ok you have to wait 20min to get a table but don't give up.Menu: there are so many tapas that you can go crazy and order more than you can handle! My recommendation: Bacalau, Boquerones en vinagre and andaluze, NavajasPrice: in couple we totally spent 62eur for 12 tapas, 2 glasses of wine and bottle of water.We were full and satisfied.  \n",

Although we have been there twice without reservations, it’s recommended to make reservations ... or be lucky like we were.They have an elaborate selection of small (tapas) and main dishes, really allowing to satisfy each taste and preference.Service is efficient, fast and quite friendly.The quality of the food, the size of the portions and the presentation are proof of the professionalism of this place.Prices are midrange and ok for what you get.Will go back.  \n",

I wanted to experience for myself what he saw and tasted. My family and I walked twice towards this restaurant for dinner! Both times we came out very satisfied and happy. Food is here is very good brought to our table by a very friendly staff. Love the service here and price is reasonable. Don't think twice. Come here. Order grilled red prawns and steak with foie gras, among many other good things-you will be happy, promise!  \n",

Everything was amazing...the food, the service, and the atmosphere! The classic Spanish tapas like patatas bravas, pan con tomates, jamon iberico, and Spanish cheeses were wonderful as well as typical Catalan dishes like artichokes with shrimp and clams, fresh fried calamari, and crema catalana. Homemade sangria was perfect. Selection of wines by the glass was great. We will definitely be back here on our next trip. Best meal of the week in Barcelona!  \n",

It did not disappoint. Great energy, vibe and food was delicious. Try the skinny fries covered in an aioli with an egg on top. Sounds simple but was very tasty.   \n",

Arrived at about 8pm and were told there was a 30 minute wait for a table. After a drink at the bar we were called to our table after about 20 minutes. It was well worth the wait! Great food, great service and all reasonably priced. Very busy, great vibe/atmosphere, would go back again tomorrow if we could!!!!  \n",

Twice the wait was about an hour long and once 30 minutes. We saw large number of people waiting on all occasions.Having said all that, the food is quite good. We tried a variety of tapas on each occasions and most were quite tasty. Price was fairly reasonable to us too. milespointstravel.com  \n",

There was a short wait, but we were able to get seats the counter after just a few minutes. The service was prompt and professional. We enjoyed a liter of sangria with a steady flow of tapas. We tried many things, but especially enjoyed the garlic shrimp and the bombas - you definitely need to try the bombas! Would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona!  \n",

The food was ok, but not tasty. I don’t recommend.  \n",

The Tapas are very nice . Everything is very tasty and there is a big variety of fish food .The wine was also very nice and the desert . You can also sit at the bar to drink your wine or beer and eat a tapas. You need to reserve a table otherwise in rash hour you must wait more than an hour .   \n",

But it really worth it. The food is at very reasonable price and very tasty.  \n",

What an amazing meal. Came here on recommendation and did not disappoint. Busy packed place. Expect to wait for few minutes. Maybe if you sit at bar. Sat at bar and had front view of dishes tapas. Had 8 tapas. Steak to prawns to shrimp peppers to codfish the best. To more double takings. Amazing taste and affordable price. 9 tapas for 30 euros plus a beer. Not bad. Come here for a local busy pack place to eat and enjoy the crowd.   \n",

The tapas as amazing! Their options are reasonably priced for their serving, and everything was delicious. The server recommended Solomillo de ternera con foie (Beef tenderloin with foie gras) and it was an absolutely precious. The staff is super helpful and efficient, excellent service. I’d go back here. I will fly back to Barcelona to eat here. Expect a queue for dinner, but who can blame them? This is a great place!  \n",

The best we ever had in Spain. We ate there 7 times.Tried all seafood and mushrooms, even the potato and grilled peppers. All good.Wish they had a menu like in the Japanese restaurants with photos. I only know a limited Spanish. of course you can google the dishes and check what others order.  \n",

The prices are a bit expensive (2-4 euro for one open sandwich), but the food is seriously high quality. Definitely make a reservation as we came and it was packed out the front door. We were seated outside but still received pretty good and fast service, enough for my girlfriend and I to have enough time to hang out and chat over the food.  \n",

We made a reservation for 12 people, but at first we were in 11, waiting for one more to arrive. In the begining the waiters were already rude, but as we were there for a nice time with Friends, we didnt want to make a big thing from that. But the episodes started to occur, for instance, when one of the waiters complained because we were not ordering all the things for once (we were in a group of 11 and we were eating tapas, so no way everybody would order at the same time). When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling. At this time we couldnt stand the situation anymore and stood up to leave. The manager probably realized he and his team f***ed up and told us to stay because he was putting another chair for our friend. Too little too late. WORST EXPERIENCE IN A RESTAURANT IN MY WHOLE LIFE.  \n",

From the begging the waiters were very rude, throwing our orders at the table and putting very strange pressure for us to order fast and in the order they wanted. We had a table for 12 people but were 11. When our 12th friend arrived, they started saying it was not possible for him to sit and started counting the number of us, as if we would be cheating wrt the number of people!! We were consuming a lot and yet receiving awful service!Pathetic.  \n",

And by the time the 12th person arrive the staff did not get a chair for her. Believe or not the manager started to count the number of people.Terrible felling as tourist....  \n",

We went there for lunch and enjoyed everything we've ordered. A large selection of Tapas could be found here. we've tried Patatas Bravas, Foie Gras with tenderloin, Shrimp Skewers and many more.  The food was fantastic. We couldn't help but to come here again for dinner during our short stay in Barcelona. It is definitely our first choice when it comes to Tapas.  \n",

If you prefer o sit at the table, you have to wait. You can be lucky and get the place at bar, which is not a bad alternative at all.Food is amazingly taste. Really difficult to choose the best one. After eating of the first pieces, you will think to order all menu. Just go there and enjoy...  \n",

This place is very popular and very busy but is it the authentic Spanish tapas experience? I think not. Perhaps go here if you have a large group or you are on a bus tour. The atmosphere is loud, brightly lit and like that of a cafeteria (maybe a wee bit nicer). The quality of the food is fair but the staff are determined to get people in and out as quickly as they can. Prices are high. Credit to the staff who are working very hard.  \n",

I think the only difference is a slightly smaller wait time (5-10 minutes) and the name on the building. I love the tapas here. Try it all, you cannot go wrong. The albariño wines are my favorite and pair well with almost everything on the menu.  \n",

The waiter who served us was helpful, though his colleague spoke little English, and was extremely brisk.There was a large number of asian tourists here; not a bad thing, but indicative of the market it caters for and the price hike as a result.The food was uniformly excellent. The fried green peppers were an unexpected delight. If money is no object, then go crazy and I'm sure you'll have a ball.  \n",

Be there early to get a sit straight away and a good time to eat the menu ! Staff are all professional meaning they rush at 100 miles an hour to serve everyone . The food is fabulous. Have not had one bad dish .  \n",

Only down side is how crowded it gets at 20h onwards and the long waiting cue at dinner time.  \n",

The selection of tapas we ordered were all great and the portion was quite big. Service is great and most staff can speak English...  \n",

And I remember having to stand (for an hour) behind someone at the counter just to secure a narrow spot for myself.But the Philippino who served me was super nice (as our countries are neighbours ).Overall it was such a lovely time and of course the yummylicious food. I went back there again the next day with a friend and yep, we still had to wait for an hour but it was a pleasant experience ❤️  \n",

English speaking. No vegan options but for those without dietary concerns or budget issues this is a great place  \n",

Not anything amazing but make sure to try calcots (grilled leeks served with romesco sauce) if there in Winter. Staff were a little bit pushy in trying to get us to have dessert.   \n",

I'm sure others would love the place and the ambiance - but it certainly wasn't to our taste...  \n",

The Codfish Fritters (daily special) were outstanding - best I’ve ever had. Very busy place, so go early.  \n",

Special thanks to Ruel! Such a friendly and positive waiter. Ask his recommendations, every dish he suggested was absolutely fabulous. My top three:- cod with honey and tomatoes;- beef with foie gras;- camembert with almonds and berries.  \n",

It was pretty packed outside and inside. Being there for the first time, we did not know where or how we could get into the queue for a table. Therefore went inside and was told off by the queue lady because we were standing on the wrong side of where we were supposed to be. Brushed that off as them being flustered due to the high number of customers but a bit of signage to let customers know where to queue would be helpful (and perhaps a little more service training for the queue lady would be awesome)Got in the queue, was told 30-45 mins. As there were a few customers in front that left, we promptly got a table. The waitress we had was patient and helpful with our orders. Food came out pretty quickly although there were some pretty hefty gaps between some orders (10-15 mins??)We tried re-ordering from a tall man with glasses but was told to “wait” and he never came back. He was constantly shaking his head at other customers after taking their orders so we took our next order with another server. Service was pretty patchy depending on which moody (or happy) person you got. Food highlights (we ordered 8 tapas for 2 people for €66.30 euro)- Cod with honey “allioli”- Beef tenderloin with foie gras- Crispy camembert- Shrimp “al ajillo”  \n",

There was such a variety of great, authentic Spanish food and we enjoyed absolutely all of it! We came back two days in a row and would be glad to return again and again! Can’t wait for friends and family to visit Spain so we can show them some EXCELLENT food :P  \n",

Best tapas- the filet with froe gras is the best I’ve ever had, grilled shrimp are delicious, and potatoes with aoli are heavenly. Reasonable prices on outstanding food, and good wine. Despite no reservations and long lines with typical waits of an hour at mealtime, it was totally worth the wait.  \n",

Grilled clams and prawns are quite good. My favorite tapas here is grilled tenderloin with foie, which is very tasty.The service is so so because this is a very busy place. The waiter forgot one of my orders.  \n",

Dinner services was average cause once we sit down we order a bottle of champagne. Lunch was in very poor services. Coffee waited for 20mins. Requested to order thought 4 staff still no one come. We tried to order signature grill octopus but the manager said only a word “no” till we saw other tables have it then another staff helped to order. What a service! Don’t understand why they need to provide such service as we are very polite. The key point is all food weren’t hot just a bit warm or even in room temperature.  \n",

We went to quite a few tapas bars- each unique. But nothing compares to the variety, service, taste and ease of ordering for non- Spanish speakers. The restaurant was recommended (again) by locals who enjoy it tooThe fillet looked amazing but we weren’t in mood for meat.  \n",

However, the tapas were very ordinary but the desserts stood out. In fact, the desserts were very impressive. I would say, just go for the foie gras with tenderloin tapas and the desserts (coconut pudding and the bread pudding!!)  \n",

They make you feel at ease when you’re eating there and the Filipino servers do know how to suggest what tapas to have and drinks to take. The server Ruel at the bar really knows what’s the fresh catch of the day are so when you’re there for the first time try to seat at the bar. Definitely, it’s worth the experience.  \n",

Great atmosphere and great service. Made our first night in Barcelona special. Yes a little on the expensive side but well worth it. Highly recommend   \n",

We ordered quite a lot of different tapas and we weren’t disappointed with any of them. All delicious and tasty. I’m always surprised at how reasonable the costs are in restaurants in Barcelona. I find them much cheaper than UK restaurants. It was roughly €120 for 5 people - we must have had 10 tapas and a paella for 2 to share with a small jug of sangria, 2 beers and several cokes. Staff were attentive, friendly and accommodating. All round great experience.  \n",

Maybe better less crowded options at same price point - not worth more than a ten minute wait - it’s just not  \n",

I am glad to say it did not disappoint! Arriving with our tired 5 year old we were treated incredibly well and the lady at the front along with Ruel made a special effort to seat us quickly. Fortunately we got sat at the bar and Ruel made us feel very special right away, giving us tips on what we should try and being so attentive, it was like he could read our minds! All of the dishes we tried were incredible and we came away eating and drinking way more than we had originally planned. The ambience, level of service and quality of food made this one of our most memorable dining experiences ever - it was so good that we came back the next night and none of the magic was lost. It also said a lot that there were faces that we had seen the previous night who were there again also.To the owners - you are lucky to have such wonderful people working at your restaurant. Along with the incredible food that you serve, they make the whole experience first class. Ruel in particular is a huge asset and we loved the way he took care of us on both nights that we visited. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Barcelona!  \n",

We had great seafood for our first visit: clams, scallops, fried small fish. When we came the second time, most seafood was run-out of stock: mussels, seafood plate ... We ended up having Spanish omelette and cod in honey sauce, which was not as tasty.  \n",

Since we've planned on a big dinner, we only wanted to order a Tapa or two. Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese & Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.  \n",

How? One waitress can change everything. He was not in the mood and affected our decisions. somehow we ordered something very weird. because of the language problems we didnt understand if we ordered something wrong or he didnt understand.   \n",

I appreciate this and had a great experience. Food was amazing and would go back anytime I can.  \n",

We ordered a couple of dishes, and expected a lot due to the reviews and recommendations from friends. All was amazing besides the razor clams, I expected a little more from the razor clams. People were nice, and our waiter was very knowledgeable. We will return again to give this another try.  \n",

Stumbled upon this restaurant that had people spilling out the door. Good that I was solo because the helpful hostess and servers at the bar got me seated immediately and I was so glad because I was able to meet Ruel, William, Jordi and a younger, cute fellow who had nickname but I can’t recall if they told me his real name. Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable. Overall the food was great, the Sangria top notch but it was the service that really sold me on the tapas place. I really hope I have some time to stop by again before my trip ends but I will be sure to come back the next time in Barcelona!  \n",

It's gotten a little touristy, but with patience you can find a table or a spot at the bar. You won't be disappointed by the quality, the variety and the prices of the tapas (i recommend shrimps). Also the sandwiches are really good.  \n",

HOWEVER, this is a tourist trap, with the worst service ever. First of all, the server acted like he didn't even want to be here. Second of all, he had ZERO knowledge about hygiene and food safety. When he brought out the first tapa ( mushrooms w egg yolk ), his thumb was touching the rim of the plate and nail was touching the mushroom. By the third tapa, he looked at me as his thumb touched the tomato bread. And he handed me a new plate with grease on it. Thinking about all the germs he had in his nails... YUCK.  \n",

The choice is enormous, every bite is heaven. And many people know this, and that is why this place during dinner times is absolutely loaded. The first time I had to come back for a table at 23:30 (thank god Barcelona had crazy dinner times). Normally between 16-17 in the afternoon you can find a place at the bar. Anyway, when in Barcelona, don't miss this place.  \n",

Some dishes better than others. Very friendly service. Worth booking places in advance as there is a long line. We sat outside but it seems that the better atmosphere is inside... we could not wait for our turn :(...  \n",

So after a long trip and an afternoon nap, this place was a great to taste several tapas, beer and wine. The razor clams are great among the other 10 tapas we tried. The nata dessert was also excellent and the service was great.   \n",

Too bad we only went there on our last night in town. Good food, great service staff. They were lively and made good recommendation for us to try. Service was quick too and we didnt have to wait long for food. However, this place is popular so go early if you want a good table. we sat outside in the cold, which was fine. Overall love this place. will be back  \n",

Thursday evening around six we were able to get a table immediately. Our server, Raquel, was very helpful explaining the differences between the tapas and mondtiditos. We ordered several items including sardines, crispy eggplant, mushrooms with asparagus codfish fritters and enjoyed everything. Two nites later we returned and Raquel remembered us. This time we tried garlic shrimp and a fried platter of squid, sardines and cuttlefish with mini poblanos plus a couple of “old favorites and a pitcher of sangria. Second dinner was even better and we then took Raquel’s dessert recommendation of bread pudding which is more of a soufflé with a creamy interior—scrumptious! Prices are very reasonable, service is quick and they are open from 9:30am to 1:30 am. If we return to Barcelona, we will return to Catalana  \n",

You can’t make a reservation, but if you eat around 6:30-7:00 you shouldn’t have much of a wait. When we left at 9:30, the line was out the door. They have a regular menu and a specials menu. A couple of dishes we wanted from the specials menu were already sold out. We loved the razor clams, the burrata salad and the ham and cheese mini sandwich the best, but everything we tried was good. Make sure to save room for the burnt St Joan bread pudding. Service was friendly and very efficient. We would definitely return.  \n",

The garlic prawns with tomato bread were the best! I also had some ham/cheese tapas, a beer and finished with some churos. It was 25 euros so well worth it. Would definitely go back! The inside is more bright and modern than I was expecting but it had a nice atmosphere and great food.\n",

High quality small dishes, with a very wide offer. It is always full, you need to queue. Go with plenty of time. The atmosphere is great, service is fast and prices are reasonable. You can have a taste of the local cuisine with several small dishes. You will not go there only once.\n",

Food comes very quickly, best to not order too much at the same time. Staff is friendly, however can appear a bit rushed as this place seems to have a waiting line outside most of the time. But really a must-try!\n",

We went back again to this restaurant a few days later and also one of it's sister restaurant Vinitus. :)\n",

       "13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I was recommended this place for Tapas during TripAdvisor search. They don't do reservations but there is a waiting list outside. First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.\n",

I went at the end of November with a colleague and they expanded the restaurant but the quality is still the same: Excellent!\n",

They were very disorganized and look lost and desperate while taking care the long waiting line.The food is good but you can find other places better than this one in barcelona. I hope they can improve their service because the place is very nice.\n",

The is absolutely the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona. The food is fantastic, the drinks and wine very good, and the overall experience is definitely value-for-money. The staff is very friendly and service minded. Its not possible to book a table, so I recommend come early or be prepared to wait for a while to be seated. Great Experience!\n",

After all the waiting the waiter started to tell us off. What? Definitely not recommended. The system of listing people outside is a mess. They don’t do reservations and everyone is packed in the front of the restaurant. And the employees tell you off. Poor service.\n",

IT WAS THAT GOOD. The front-of-house was really friendly and accommodating. There was a long line-up or queue but it was worth it! Raquel was our server and she was the best! She recommended a lot of their popular tapas, and they did not disappoint at all! It was so so good! The seafood was fresh and properly cooked, we had grilled figs that was so fresh, and mushrooms with egg yolk. It was all divine. Everything was served nice and hot. The garlic shrimp, galician clams, grilled cuttlefish, and many more, are definitely what to order. The staff was absolutely friendly.\n",

We had a big table, they made us leave because someone else was coming. But in the same time they did not let us book a table earlier. \n",

The food was fantastic - great quality, freshly cooked and quickly served. We had been told about this place by friends who had been before and it didn’t disappoint!You can’t book but you turn up and leave your name and they tell you roughly how long until your table is ready, so you can nip off for a drink nearby then come back, which is what we did. Our table was called promptly when we came back so we didn’t have to wait. It is always very busy so make sure you are there when your name is called as I would imagine they don’t hold tables for long!The service was impeccable and very quick. The place is very buzzing and full of atmosphere, so it was great fun - but not the place for a quiet, leisurely meal.

Each time we think of the city, this restaurant comes to mind first. The food is excellent and the best service.The staff are very nice. Price is reasonable. Yes, the line is often long but it's worth the wait. If/when we go back to Barcelona and this restaurant is the first stop!!\n",

We waited about 25 minutes for a table at around 8.30pm on a Sunday evening. The staff were friendly, the restaurant was spotlessly clean and the food was excellent. The two of us shared some red prawns, razor clams, some beef and some whitebait, followed by a kind of bread pudding and churros, plus a jug of sangria. Everything was excellent. \n",

What a fantastic find. Hugely popular, with quite a queue, but very well worth the wait. The razor clams were fabulous, as was the anchovy montadito, the croquettes, the burnt Sant Teresa torrija and the house chardonnay. Very reasonably priced. Sherwin (waiter) was excellent.\n",

I ate around 13:30, so it may have been slow and too early, but everything just seemed slow and mediocre in the restaurant.I ordered 4 different types of tapas, and only liked 1 of the items.It's a very tourist-recommended location, but I'd suggest trying other local restaurants.\n",

The Maitre d Rachez wasan incredible host. She made you feel great even if their was a wait. The food was incredible. We had multiple Shrimp types, Potatas Bravas, beef tenderloin, mini burgers, calamari, fist, etc. The sangria was to die for. One thing to note was that there were 3 other girls who waited on us - Cherry, Elsie, and Vangie. When the were not running plates, they were busy getting the place in order (moving plates, cleaning up, etc.) Thank you Girls - You run that joint. Overall, we loved it here and would go back again and again.\n",

It has a good location, a buzz about it, and clearly has excellent word of mouth. We came a few years ago, and have just returned this weekend. Over the years we have recommended it to many people.You go outside, put your name on the list, get told your waiting time, and come back after having had a drink elsewhere. Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!\n",

I want to share my disappointment with this place. They have bad service and terrible food. We ordered several tapas, but the waitress decided he was not going to place all the order. When we asked why he didn't bring all the order out he said then that we don't live in SLAVE time anymore. I was so surprised with his answer, so I requested to please speak with the manager. We found out he waa the manager. He moved on with screaming, yelling and behaving as a terrible person and forgot his service job. We left that place and will NEVER return. Don't waste your time and money place, find instead the other better tapas places in Barcelona.\n",

It was our first time trying tapas and we weren’t sure what to order so the waiter ordered for us. All of his suggestions were finger-licking good, the dessert too! Will definitely be coming back more often.\n",

Some of the dishes change daily, but we thought they were all great (some pictures attached). Our particular favourite was the cabreaos eggs (spicy eggs), which is a bit of a play on eggs and chips ( and like 6 euro !)We tried most of the menu, and particularly loved all the seafood (and the tomato bread !) We will DEFINITELY be coming back here when we return to Barcelona!\n",

Expunge for the quality we’ve received. Also we ordered a dish saying salat included and it arrived without it.

The place is generally crowded and there is a long waiting line (I went a week ago and tables were very spaced out, more relaxed and we were admitted quickly, these changes are due to covid) despite this, IT IS AMAZING and very, very, very worth it. The food is beyond incredible and dinning is an experience, fast paced and with many tapas ordered, it is fun, enjoyable and very exciting. I will never stop recommending it for locals or tourists. I have heard immaculate reviews from others. Definitely go if you have the oportunity :)\n",

This is the first time that I'm really suspicious to a rating on TripAdvisor. How on earth can a restaurant like this have 4,5 with over 12 000 ratings. That is a mystery for me. The service was really a disgrace and the food was OK, nothing more. We were given a menu that was printed out on a paper and the printing black ink was faded on the menu so we couldn't read all of the menu and we couldn't see the prizes. When I told the waiter this he just showed me that all the menus were like that. Hahaha!And the dishes on the menu had no description so you had no idea what some of the stuff was or any sort of detail to it. There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it. We went away both hungry and just laughing at the entire experience. This was definitely our first and last time here.Spare your money and go to other restaurants that a actually great - there are plenty of them in Barcelona. \n",

So Very Uncool. Especially that they didnt even try to find us other solution.Positiv: -8pm we could get a table without waiting-2 delicious tapas: sirloin and potatoes with eggs (all other tapas we took was maximum average quality)I was expected much better from this many positive feedbacks but I wouldnt come back here to eat. It would have been nicer in a smaller bar or restaurant where they care about the costumers.\n",

We ended up here for breakfast every day! Great, simple breakfast menu with fantastically reasonable prices! We had lunch here one day too but for us breakfast stole the show! Always busy so be prepared to wait a bit but it was worth it for us!\n",

But if you don't present full they won't let you sit on the table.Totally absence of Customer centricity.I have already arranged a business meeting in that place otherwise I would spare my money there \n",

Always a pleasure! Great local food, always fresh, always tasty. Each time we've tried something else in the menu.This time we've set on the bar and had a great \"closer\" service experience as well.Until next time....\n",
       "53     I have been going to this restaurant ever since I arrived in Barcelona 2 years ago and have recommended it to many of my colleagues and friends. However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET ROBBED WHILE ENJOYING YOUR MEAL AND THEN TREATED LIKE YOU ARE A THIEF AND TOLD YOU MUST NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU PAY THEN GO AHEAD AND EAT HERE.\n",

I visited this place for the first time 8 years ago and now the plates are much smaller and the prices much higher, so I was a bit dissapointed during my second visit :/\n",

When he stopped because he couldn’t walk more (just for a minute or some seconds) they couldn’t stop telling me rudely to move him out of the way because he was “bothering”. I understand they need to walk fast without obstacles and everything, but he was just laying down and annoying nobody. Unless they can cure him I can’t do anything else apart from waiting, but it’s not necessary to be so rude for just a sick dog that can’t move and needs to rest.Never gonna eat there ever again.\n",

Exactly what I was expecting from a local tapas place. Ok you have to wait 20min to get a table but don't give up.Menu: there are so many tapas that you can go crazy and order more than you can handle! My recommendation: Bacalau, Boquerones en vinagre and andaluze, NavajasPrice: in couple we totally spent 62eur for 12 tapas, 2 glasses of wine and bottle of water.We were full and satisfied.\n",

Although we have been there twice without reservations, it’s recommended to make reservations ... or be lucky like we were.They have an elaborate selection of small (tapas) and main dishes, really allowing to satisfy each taste and preference.Service is efficient, fast and quite friendly.The quality of the food, the size of the portions and the presentation are proof of the professionalism of this place.Prices are midrange and ok for what you get.Will go back.\n",

I wanted to experience for myself what he saw and tasted. My family and I walked twice towards this restaurant for dinner! Both times we came out very satisfied and happy. Food is here is very good brought to our table by a very friendly staff. Love the service here and price is reasonable. Don't think twice. Come here. Order grilled red prawns and steak with foie gras, among many other good things-you will be happy, promise!\n",

Everything was amazing...the food, the service, and the atmosphere! The classic Spanish tapas like patatas bravas, pan con tomates, jamon iberico, and Spanish cheeses were wonderful as well as typical Catalan dishes like artichokes with shrimp and clams, fresh fried calamari, and crema catalana. Homemade sangria was perfect. Selection of wines by the glass was great. We will definitely be back here on our next trip. Best meal of the week in Barcelona!\n",

It did not disappoint. Great energy, vibe and food was delicious. Try the skinny fries covered in an aioli with an egg on top. Sounds simple but was very tasty. \n",

Arrived at about 8pm and were told there was a 30 minute wait for a table. After a drink at the bar we were called to our table after about 20 minutes. It was well worth the wait! Great food, great service and all reasonably priced. Very busy, great vibe/atmosphere, would go back again tomorrow if we could!!!!\n",

Twice the wait was about an hour long and once 30 minutes. We saw large number of people waiting on all occasions.Having said all that, the food is quite good. We tried a variety of tapas on each occasions and most were quite tasty. Price was fairly reasonable to us too. milespointstravel.com\n",

There was a short wait, but we were able to get seats the counter after just a few minutes. The service was prompt and professional. We enjoyed a liter of sangria with a steady flow of tapas. We tried many things, but especially enjoyed the garlic shrimp and the bombas - you definitely need to try the bombas! Would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona!\n",

The Tapas are very nice . Everything is very tasty and there is a big variety of fish food .The wine was also very nice and the desert . You can also sit at the bar to drink your wine or beer and eat a tapas. You need to reserve a table otherwise in rash hour you must wait more than an hour . \n",

What an amazing meal. Came here on recommendation and did not disappoint. Busy packed place. Expect to wait for few minutes. Maybe if you sit at bar. Sat at bar and had front view of dishes tapas.

The tapas as amazing! Their options are reasonably priced for their serving, and everything was delicious. The server recommended Solomillo de ternera con foie (Beef tenderloin with foie gras) and it was an absolutely precious. The staff is super helpful and efficient, excellent service. I’d go back here. I will fly back to Barcelona to eat here. Expect a queue for dinner, but who can blame them? This is a great place!\n",

The best we ever had in Spain. We ate there 7 times.Tried all seafood and mushrooms, even the potato and grilled peppers. All good.Wish they had a menu like in the Japanese restaurants with photos. I only know a limited Spanish. of course you can google the dishes and check what others order.\n",

The prices are a bit expensive (2-4 euro for one open sandwich), but the food is seriously high quality. Definitely make a reservation as we came and it was packed out the front door. We were seated outside but still received pretty good and fast service, enough for my girlfriend and I to have enough time to hang out and chat over the food.\n",

We made a reservation for 12 people, but at first we were in 11, waiting for one more to arrive. In the begining the waiters were already rude, but as we were there for a nice time with Friends, we didnt want to make a big thing from that. But the episodes started to occur, for instance, when one of the waiters complained because we were not ordering all the things for once (we were in a group of 11 and we were eating tapas, so no way everybody would order at the same time). When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling. At this time we couldnt stand the situation anymore and stood up to leave. The manager probably realized he and his team f***ed up and told us to stay because he was putting another chair for our friend. Too little too late. WORST EXPERIENCE IN A RESTAURANT IN MY WHOLE LIFE.\n",

From the begging the waiters were very rude, throwing our orders at the table and putting very strange pressure for us to order fast and in the order they wanted. We had a table for 12 people but were 11. When our 12th friend arrived, they started saying it was not possible for him to sit and started counting the number of us, as if we would be cheating wrt the number of people!! We were consuming a lot and yet receiving awful service!Pathetic.\n",

And by the time the 12th person arrive the staff did not get a chair for her. Believe or not the manager started to count the number of people.Terrible felling as tourist....\n",

We went there for lunch and enjoyed everything we've ordered. A large selection of Tapas could be found here. we've tried Patatas Bravas, Foie Gras with tenderloin, Shrimp Skewers and many more.  The food was fantastic. We couldn't help but to come here again for dinner during our short stay in Barcelona. It is definitely our first choice when it comes to Tapas.\n",

If you prefer o sit at the table, you have to wait. You can be lucky and get the place at bar, which is not a bad alternative at all.Food is amazingly taste. Really difficult to choose the best one. After eating of the first pieces, you will think to order all menu. Just go there and enjoy...\n",

This place is very popular and very busy but is it the authentic Spanish tapas experience? I think not. Perhaps go here if you have a large group or you are on a bus tour. The atmosphere is loud, brightly lit and like that of a cafeteria (maybe a wee bit nicer). The quality of the food is fair but the staff are determined to get people in and out as quickly as they can. Prices are high. Credit to the staff who are working very hard.\n",

I think the only difference is a slightly smaller wait time (5-10 minutes) and the name on the building. I love the tapas here. Try it all, you cannot go wrong. The albariño wines are my favorite and pair well with almost everything on the menu.\n",

The waiter who served us was helpful, though his colleague spoke little English, and was extremely brisk.There was a large number of asian tourists here; not a bad thing, but indicative of the market it caters for and the price hike as a result.The food was uniformly excellent. The fried green peppers were an unexpected delight. If money is no object, then go crazy and I'm sure you'll have a ball.\n",

Be there early to get a sit straight away and a good time to eat the menu ! Staff are all professional meaning they rush at 100 miles an hour to serve everyone . The food is fabulous.

Only down side is how crowded it gets at 20h onwards and the long waiting cue at dinner time.\n",

The selection of tapas we ordered were all great and the portion was quite big. Service is great and most staff can speak English...\n",

And I remember having to stand (for an hour) behind someone at the counter just to secure a narrow spot for myself.But the Philippino who served me was super nice (as our countries are neighbours ).Overall it was such a lovely time and of course the yummylicious food. I went back there again the next day with a friend and yep, we still had to wait for an hour but it was a pleasant experience ❤️\n",

English speaking. No vegan options but for those without dietary concerns or budget issues this is a great place\n",

Not anything amazing but make sure to try calcots (grilled leeks served with romesco sauce) if there in Winter. Staff were a little bit pushy in trying to get us to have dessert. \n",

I'm sure others would love the place and the ambiance - but it certainly wasn't to our taste...\n",

The Codfish Fritters (daily special) were outstanding - best I’ve ever had. Very busy place, so go early.\n",

Special thanks to Ruel! Such a friendly and positive waiter. Ask his recommendations, every dish he suggested was absolutely fabulous. My top three:- cod with honey and tomatoes;- beef with foie gras;- camembert with almonds and berries.\n",

It was pretty packed outside and inside. Being there for the first time, we did not know where or how we could get into the queue for a table. Therefore went inside and was told off by the queue lady because we were standing on the wrong side of where we were supposed to be. Brushed that off as them being flustered due to the high number of customers but a bit of signage to let customers know where to queue would be helpful (and perhaps a little more service training for the queue lady would be awesome)Got in the queue, was told 30-45 mins. As there were a few customers in front that left, we promptly got a table. The waitress we had was patient and helpful with our orders. Food came out pretty quickly although there were some pretty hefty gaps between some orders (10-15 mins??)We tried re-ordering from a tall man with glasses but was told to “wait” and he never came back. He was constantly shaking his head at other customers after taking their orders so we took our next order with another server. Service was pretty patchy depending on which moody (or happy) person you got. Food highlights (we ordered 8 tapas for 2 people for €66.30 euro)- Cod with honey “allioli”- Beef tenderloin with foie gras- Crispy camembert- Shrimp “al ajillo”\n",

There was such a variety of great, authentic Spanish food and we enjoyed absolutely all of it! We came back two days in a row and would be glad to return again and again! Can’t wait for friends and family to visit Spain so we can show them some EXCELLENT food :P\n",

Best tapas- the filet with froe gras is the best I’ve ever had, grilled shrimp are delicious, and potatoes with aoli are heavenly. Reasonable prices on outstanding food, and good wine. Despite no reservations and long lines with typical waits of an hour at mealtime, it was totally worth the wait.\n",

Grilled clams and prawns are quite good. My favorite tapas here is grilled tenderloin with foie, which is very tasty.The service is so so because this is a very busy place. The waiter forgot one of my orders.\n",

Dinner services was average cause once we sit down we order a bottle of champagne. Lunch was in very poor services. Coffee waited for 20mins. Requested to order thought 4 staff still no one come. We tried to order signature grill octopus but the manager said only a word “no” till we saw other tables have it then another staff helped to order. What a service! Don’t understand why they need to provide such service as we are very polite. The key point is all food weren’t hot just a bit warm or even in room temperature.\n",

We went to quite a few tapas bars- each unique. But nothing compares to the variety, service, taste and ease of ordering for non- Spanish speakers. The restaurant was recommended (again) by locals who enjoy it tooThe fillet looked amazing but we weren’t in mood for meat.\n",

However, the tapas were very ordinary but the desserts stood out. In fact, the desserts were very impressive. I would say, just go for the foie gras with tenderloin tapas and the desserts (coconut pudding and the bread pudding!!)\n",

They make you feel at ease when you’re eating there and the Filipino servers do know how to suggest what tapas to have and drinks to take. The server Ruel at the bar really knows what’s the fresh catch of the day are so when you’re there for the first time try to seat at the bar. Definitely, it’s worth the experience.\n",

Great atmosphere and great service. Made our first night in Barcelona special. Yes a little on the expensive side but well worth it. Highly recommend \n",

We ordered quite a lot of different tapas and we weren’t disappointed with any of them. All delicious and tasty. I’m always surprised at how reasonable the costs are in restaurants in Barcelona. I find them much cheaper than UK restaurants. It was roughly €120 for 5 people - we must have had 10 tapas and a paella for 2 to share with a small jug of sangria, 2 beers and several cokes. Staff were attentive, friendly and accommodating. All round great experience.\n",

Maybe better less crowded options at same price point - not worth more than a ten minute wait - it’s just not\n",

I am glad to say it did not disappoint! Arriving with our tired 5 year old we were treated incredibly well and the lady at the front along with Ruel made a special effort to seat us quickly. Fortunately we got sat at the bar and Ruel made us feel very special right away, giving us tips on what we should try and being so attentive, it was like he could read our minds! All of the dishes we tried were incredible and we came away eating and drinking way more than we had originally planned. The ambience, level of service and quality of food made this one of our most memorable dining experiences ever - it was so good that we came back the next night and none of the magic was lost. It also said a lot that there were faces that we had seen the previous night who were there again also.To the owners - you are lucky to have such wonderful people working at your restaurant. Along with the incredible food that you serve, they make the whole experience first class. Ruel in particular is a huge asset and we loved the way he took care of us on both nights that we visited. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Barcelona!\n",

We had great seafood for our first visit: clams, scallops, fried small fish. When we came the second time, most seafood was run-out of stock: mussels, seafood plate ... We ended up having Spanish omelette and cod in honey sauce, which was not as tasty.\n",

Since we've planned on a big dinner, we only wanted to order a Tapa or two. Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese & Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.\n",

How? One waitress can change everything. He was not in the mood and affected our decisions. somehow we ordered something very weird. because of the language problems we didnt understand if we ordered something wrong or he didnt understand. \n",

I appreciate this and had a great experience. Food was amazing and would go back anytime I can.\n",

We ordered a couple of dishes, and expected a lot due to the reviews and recommendations from friends. All was amazing besides the razor clams, I expected a little more from the razor clams. People were nice, and our waiter was very knowledgeable. We will return again to give this another try.\n",

Stumbled upon this restaurant that had people spilling out the door. Good that I was solo because the helpful hostess and servers at the bar got me seated immediately and I was so glad because I was able to meet Ruel, William, Jordi and a younger, cute fellow who had nickname but I can’t recall if they told me his real name. Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable. Overall the food was great, the Sangria top notch but it was the service that really sold me on the tapas place. I really hope I have some time to stop by again before my trip ends but I will be sure to come back the next time in Barcelona!\n",

It's gotten a little touristy, but with patience you can find a table or a spot at the bar. You won't be disappointed by the quality, the variety and the prices of the tapas (i recommend shrimps). Also the sandwiches are really good.\n",

HOWEVER, this is a tourist trap, with the worst service ever. First of all, the server acted like he didn't even want to be here. Second of all, he had ZERO knowledge about hygiene and food safety. When he brought out the first tapa ( mushrooms w egg yolk ), his thumb was touching the rim of the plate and nail was touching the mushroom. By the third tapa, he looked at me as his thumb touched the tomato bread. And he handed me a new plate with grease on it. Thinking about all the germs he had in his nails... YUCK.\n",

The choice is enormous, every bite is heaven. And many people know this, and that is why this place during dinner times is absolutely loaded. The first time I had to come back for a table at 23:30 (thank god Barcelona had crazy dinner times). Normally between 16-17 in the afternoon you can find a place at the bar. Anyway, when in Barcelona, don't miss this place.\n",

Some dishes better than others. Very friendly service. Worth booking places in advance as there is a long line. We sat outside but it seems that the better atmosphere is inside... we could not wait for our turn :(...\n",

So after a long trip and an afternoon nap, this place was a great to taste several tapas, beer and wine. The razor clams are great among the other 10 tapas we tried. The nata dessert was also excellent and the service was great. \n",

Too bad we only went there on our last night in town. Good food, great service staff. They were lively and made good recommendation for us to try. Service was quick too and we didnt have to wait long for food. However, this place is popular so go early if you want a good table. we sat outside in the cold, which was fine. Overall love this place. will be back\n",

Thursday evening around six we were able to get a table immediately. Our server, Raquel, was very helpful explaining the differences between the tapas and mondtiditos. We ordered several items including sardines, crispy eggplant, mushrooms with asparagus codfish fritters and enjoyed everything. Two nites later we returned and Raquel remembered us. This time we tried garlic shrimp and a fried platter of squid, sardines and cuttlefish with mini poblanos plus a couple of “old favorites and a pitcher of sangria. Second dinner was even better and we then took Raquel’s dessert recommendation of bread pudding which is more of a soufflé with a creamy interior—scrumptious! Prices are very reasonable, service is quick and they are open from 9:30am to 1:30 am. If we return to Barcelona, we will return to Catalana\n",

You can’t make a reservation, but if you eat around 6:30-7:00 you shouldn’t have much of a wait. When we left at 9:30, the line was out the door. They have a regular menu and a specials menu. A couple of dishes we wanted from the specials menu were already sold out. We loved the razor clams, the burrata salad and the ham and cheese mini sandwich the best, but everything we tried was good. Make sure to save room for the burnt St Joan bread pudding. Service was friendly and very efficient. We would definitely return.\n",

The garlic prawns with tomato bread were the best! I also had some ham/cheese tapas, a beer and finished with some churos. It was 25 euros so well worth it. Would definitely go back! The inside is more bright and modern than I was expecting but it had a nice atmosphere and great food.\n",

High quality small dishes, with a very wide offer. It is always full, you need to queue. Go with plenty of time. The atmosphere is great, service is fast and prices are reasonable. You can have a taste of the local cuisine with several small dishes. You will not go there only once.\n",

Food comes very quickly, best to not order too much at the same time. Staff is friendly, however can appear a bit rushed as this place seems to have a waiting line outside most of the time. But really a must-try!\n",

We went back again to this restaurant a few days later and also one of it's sister restaurant Vinitus. :)\n",

       "13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I was recommended this place for Tapas during TripAdvisor search. They don't do reservations but there is a waiting list outside. First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.\n",

I went at the end of November with a colleague and they expanded the restaurant but the quality is still the same: Excellent!\n",

They were very disorganized and look lost and desperate while taking care the long waiting line.The food is good but you can find other places better than this one in barcelona. I hope they can improve their service because the place is very nice.\n",

The is absolutely the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona. The food is fantastic, the drinks and wine very good, and the overall experience is definitely value-for-money. The staff is very friendly and service minded. Its not possible to book a table, so I recommend come early or be prepared to wait for a while to be seated. Great Experience!\n",

After all the waiting the waiter started to tell us off. What? Definitely not recommended. The system of listing people outside is a mess. They don’t do reservations and everyone is packed in the front of the restaurant. And the employees tell you off. Poor service.\n",

IT WAS THAT GOOD. The front-of-house was really friendly and accommodating. There was a long line-up or queue but it was worth it! Raquel was our server and she was the best! She recommended a lot of their popular tapas, and they did not disappoint at all! It was so so good! The seafood was fresh and properly cooked, we had grilled figs that was so fresh, and mushrooms with egg yolk. It was all divine. Everything was served nice and hot. The garlic shrimp, galician clams, grilled cuttlefish, and many more, are definitely what to order. The staff was absolutely friendly.\n",

We had a big table, they made us leave because someone else was coming. But in the same time they did not let us book a table earlier. \n",

The food was fantastic - great quality, freshly cooked and quickly served. We had been told about this place by friends who had been before and it didn’t disappoint!You can’t book but you turn up and leave your name and they tell you roughly how long until your table is ready, so you can nip off for a drink nearby then come back, which is what we did. Our table was called promptly when we came back so we didn’t have to wait. It is always very busy so make sure you are there when your name is called as I would imagine they don’t hold tables for long!The service was impeccable and very quick. The place is very buzzing and full of atmosphere, so it was great fun - but not the place for a quiet, leisurely meal.

Each time we think of the city, this restaurant comes to mind first. The food is excellent and the best service.The staff are very nice. Price is reasonable. Yes, the line is often long but it's worth the wait. If/when we go back to Barcelona and this restaurant is the first stop!!\n",

We waited about 25 minutes for a table at around 8.30pm on a Sunday evening. The staff were friendly, the restaurant was spotlessly clean and the food was excellent. The two of us shared some red prawns, razor clams, some beef and some whitebait, followed by a kind of bread pudding and churros, plus a jug of sangria. Everything was excellent. \n",

What a fantastic find. Hugely popular, with quite a queue, but very well worth the wait. The razor clams were fabulous, as was the anchovy montadito, the croquettes, the burnt Sant Teresa torrija and the house chardonnay. Very reasonably priced. Sherwin (waiter) was excellent.\n",

I ate around 13:30, so it may have been slow and too early, but everything just seemed slow and mediocre in the restaurant.I ordered 4 different types of tapas, and only liked 1 of the items.It's a very tourist-recommended location, but I'd suggest trying other local restaurants.\n",

The Maitre d Rachez wasan incredible host. She made you feel great even if their was a wait. The food was incredible. We had multiple Shrimp types, Potatas Bravas, beef tenderloin, mini burgers, calamari, fist, etc. The sangria was to die for. One thing to note was that there were 3 other girls who waited on us - Cherry, Elsie, and Vangie. When the were not running plates, they were busy getting the place in order (moving plates, cleaning up, etc.) Thank you Girls - You run that joint. Overall, we loved it here and would go back again and again.\n",

It has a good location, a buzz about it, and clearly has excellent word of mouth. We came a few years ago, and have just returned this weekend. Over the years we have recommended it to many people.You go outside, put your name on the list, get told your waiting time, and come back after having had a drink elsewhere. Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!\n",

I want to share my disappointment with this place. They have bad service and terrible food. We ordered several tapas, but the waitress decided he was not going to place all the order. When we asked why he didn't bring all the order out he said then that we don't live in SLAVE time anymore. I was so surprised with his answer, so I requested to please speak with the manager. We found out he waa the manager. He moved on with screaming, yelling and behaving as a terrible person and forgot his service job. We left that place and will NEVER return. Don't waste your time and money place, find instead the other better tapas places in Barcelona.\n",

It was our first time trying tapas and we weren’t sure what to order so the waiter ordered for us. All of his suggestions were finger-licking good, the dessert too! Will definitely be coming back more often.\n",

Some of the dishes change daily, but we thought they were all great (some pictures attached). Our particular favourite was the cabreaos eggs (spicy eggs), which is a bit of a play on eggs and chips ( and like 6 euro !)We tried most of the menu, and particularly loved all the seafood (and the tomato bread !) We will DEFINITELY be coming back here when we return to Barcelona!\n",

Expunge for the quality we’ve received. Also we ordered a dish saying salat included and it arrived without it.

The place is generally crowded and there is a long waiting line (I went a week ago and tables were very spaced out, more relaxed and we were admitted quickly, these changes are due to covid) despite this, IT IS AMAZING and very, very, very worth it. The food is beyond incredible and dinning is an experience, fast paced and with many tapas ordered, it is fun, enjoyable and very exciting. I will never stop recommending it for locals or tourists. I have heard immaculate reviews from others. Definitely go if you have the oportunity :)\n",

This is the first time that I'm really suspicious to a rating on TripAdvisor. How on earth can a restaurant like this have 4,5 with over 12 000 ratings. That is a mystery for me. The service was really a disgrace and the food was OK, nothing more. We were given a menu that was printed out on a paper and the printing black ink was faded on the menu so we couldn't read all of the menu and we couldn't see the prizes. When I told the waiter this he just showed me that all the menus were like that. Hahaha!And the dishes on the menu had no description so you had no idea what some of the stuff was or any sort of detail to it. There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it. We went away both hungry and just laughing at the entire experience. This was definitely our first and last time here.Spare your money and go to other restaurants that a actually great - there are plenty of them in Barcelona. \n",

So Very Uncool. Especially that they didnt even try to find us other solution.Positiv: -8pm we could get a table without waiting-2 delicious tapas: sirloin and potatoes with eggs (all other tapas we took was maximum average quality)I was expected much better from this many positive feedbacks but I wouldnt come back here to eat. It would have been nicer in a smaller bar or restaurant where they care about the costumers.\n",

We ended up here for breakfast every day! Great, simple breakfast menu with fantastically reasonable prices! We had lunch here one day too but for us breakfast stole the show! Always busy so be prepared to wait a bit but it was worth it for us!\n",

But if you don't present full they won't let you sit on the table.Totally absence of Customer centricity.I have already arranged a business meeting in that place otherwise I would spare my money there \n",

Always a pleasure! Great local food, always fresh, always tasty. Each time we've tried something else in the menu.This time we've set on the bar and had a great \"closer\" service experience as well.Until next time....\n",
       "53     I have been going to this restaurant ever since I arrived in Barcelona 2 years ago and have recommended it to many of my colleagues and friends. However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET ROBBED WHILE ENJOYING YOUR MEAL AND THEN TREATED LIKE YOU ARE A THIEF AND TOLD YOU MUST NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU PAY THEN GO AHEAD AND EAT HERE.\n",

I visited this place for the first time 8 years ago and now the plates are much smaller and the prices much higher, so I was a bit dissapointed during my second visit :/\n",

When he stopped because he couldn’t walk more (just for a minute or some seconds) they couldn’t stop telling me rudely to move him out of the way because he was “bothering”. I understand they need to walk fast without obstacles and everything, but he was just laying down and annoying nobody. Unless they can cure him I can’t do anything else apart from waiting, but it’s not necessary to be so rude for just a sick dog that can’t move and needs to rest.Never gonna eat there ever again.\n",

Exactly what I was expecting from a local tapas place. Ok you have to wait 20min to get a table but don't give up.Menu: there are so many tapas that you can go crazy and order more than you can handle! My recommendation: Bacalau, Boquerones en vinagre and andaluze, NavajasPrice: in couple we totally spent 62eur for 12 tapas, 2 glasses of wine and bottle of water.We were full and satisfied.\n",

Although we have been there twice without reservations, it’s recommended to make reservations ... or be lucky like we were.They have an elaborate selection of small (tapas) and main dishes, really allowing to satisfy each taste and preference.Service is efficient, fast and quite friendly.The quality of the food, the size of the portions and the presentation are proof of the professionalism of this place.Prices are midrange and ok for what you get.Will go back.\n",

I wanted to experience for myself what he saw and tasted. My family and I walked twice towards this restaurant for dinner! Both times we came out very satisfied and happy. Food is here is very good brought to our table by a very friendly staff. Love the service here and price is reasonable. Don't think twice. Come here. Order grilled red prawns and steak with foie gras, among many other good things-you will be happy, promise!\n",

Everything was amazing...the food, the service, and the atmosphere! The classic Spanish tapas like patatas bravas, pan con tomates, jamon iberico, and Spanish cheeses were wonderful as well as typical Catalan dishes like artichokes with shrimp and clams, fresh fried calamari, and crema catalana. Homemade sangria was perfect. Selection of wines by the glass was great. We will definitely be back here on our next trip. Best meal of the week in Barcelona!\n",

It did not disappoint. Great energy, vibe and food was delicious. Try the skinny fries covered in an aioli with an egg on top. Sounds simple but was very tasty. \n",

Arrived at about 8pm and were told there was a 30 minute wait for a table. After a drink at the bar we were called to our table after about 20 minutes. It was well worth the wait! Great food, great service and all reasonably priced. Very busy, great vibe/atmosphere, would go back again tomorrow if we could!!!!\n",

Twice the wait was about an hour long and once 30 minutes. We saw large number of people waiting on all occasions.Having said all that, the food is quite good. We tried a variety of tapas on each occasions and most were quite tasty. Price was fairly reasonable to us too. milespointstravel.com\n",

There was a short wait, but we were able to get seats the counter after just a few minutes. The service was prompt and professional. We enjoyed a liter of sangria with a steady flow of tapas. We tried many things, but especially enjoyed the garlic shrimp and the bombas - you definitely need to try the bombas! Would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona!\n",

The Tapas are very nice . Everything is very tasty and there is a big variety of fish food .The wine was also very nice and the desert . You can also sit at the bar to drink your wine or beer and eat a tapas. You need to reserve a table otherwise in rash hour you must wait more than an hour . \n",

What an amazing meal. Came here on recommendation and did not disappoint. Busy packed place. Expect to wait for few minutes. Maybe if you sit at bar. Sat at bar and had front view of dishes tapas.

The tapas as amazing! Their options are reasonably priced for their serving, and everything was delicious. The server recommended Solomillo de ternera con foie (Beef tenderloin with foie gras) and it was an absolutely precious. The staff is super helpful and efficient, excellent service. I’d go back here. I will fly back to Barcelona to eat here. Expect a queue for dinner, but who can blame them? This is a great place!\n",

The best we ever had in Spain. We ate there 7 times.Tried all seafood and mushrooms, even the potato and grilled peppers. All good.Wish they had a menu like in the Japanese restaurants with photos. I only know a limited Spanish. of course you can google the dishes and check what others order.\n",

The prices are a bit expensive (2-4 euro for one open sandwich), but the food is seriously high quality. Definitely make a reservation as we came and it was packed out the front door. We were seated outside but still received pretty good and fast service, enough for my girlfriend and I to have enough time to hang out and chat over the food.\n",

We made a reservation for 12 people, but at first we were in 11, waiting for one more to arrive. In the begining the waiters were already rude, but as we were there for a nice time with Friends, we didnt want to make a big thing from that. But the episodes started to occur, for instance, when one of the waiters complained because we were not ordering all the things for once (we were in a group of 11 and we were eating tapas, so no way everybody would order at the same time). When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling. At this time we couldnt stand the situation anymore and stood up to leave. The manager probably realized he and his team f***ed up and told us to stay because he was putting another chair for our friend. Too little too late. WORST EXPERIENCE IN A RESTAURANT IN MY WHOLE LIFE.\n",

From the begging the waiters were very rude, throwing our orders at the table and putting very strange pressure for us to order fast and in the order they wanted. We had a table for 12 people but were 11. When our 12th friend arrived, they started saying it was not possible for him to sit and started counting the number of us, as if we would be cheating wrt the number of people!! We were consuming a lot and yet receiving awful service!Pathetic.\n",

And by the time the 12th person arrive the staff did not get a chair for her. Believe or not the manager started to count the number of people.Terrible felling as tourist....\n",

We went there for lunch and enjoyed everything we've ordered. A large selection of Tapas could be found here. we've tried Patatas Bravas, Foie Gras with tenderloin, Shrimp Skewers and many more.  The food was fantastic. We couldn't help but to come here again for dinner during our short stay in Barcelona. It is definitely our first choice when it comes to Tapas.\n",

If you prefer o sit at the table, you have to wait. You can be lucky and get the place at bar, which is not a bad alternative at all.Food is amazingly taste. Really difficult to choose the best one. After eating of the first pieces, you will think to order all menu. Just go there and enjoy...\n",

This place is very popular and very busy but is it the authentic Spanish tapas experience? I think not. Perhaps go here if you have a large group or you are on a bus tour. The atmosphere is loud, brightly lit and like that of a cafeteria (maybe a wee bit nicer). The quality of the food is fair but the staff are determined to get people in and out as quickly as they can. Prices are high. Credit to the staff who are working very hard.\n",

I think the only difference is a slightly smaller wait time (5-10 minutes) and the name on the building. I love the tapas here. Try it all, you cannot go wrong. The albariño wines are my favorite and pair well with almost everything on the menu.\n",

The waiter who served us was helpful, though his colleague spoke little English, and was extremely brisk.There was a large number of asian tourists here; not a bad thing, but indicative of the market it caters for and the price hike as a result.The food was uniformly excellent. The fried green peppers were an unexpected delight. If money is no object, then go crazy and I'm sure you'll have a ball.\n",

Be there early to get a sit straight away and a good time to eat the menu ! Staff are all professional meaning they rush at 100 miles an hour to serve everyone . The food is fabulous.

Only down side is how crowded it gets at 20h onwards and the long waiting cue at dinner time.\n",

The selection of tapas we ordered were all great and the portion was quite big. Service is great and most staff can speak English...\n",

And I remember having to stand (for an hour) behind someone at the counter just to secure a narrow spot for myself.But the Philippino who served me was super nice (as our countries are neighbours ).Overall it was such a lovely time and of course the yummylicious food. I went back there again the next day with a friend and yep, we still had to wait for an hour but it was a pleasant experience ❤️\n",

English speaking. No vegan options but for those without dietary concerns or budget issues this is a great place\n",

Not anything amazing but make sure to try calcots (grilled leeks served with romesco sauce) if there in Winter. Staff were a little bit pushy in trying to get us to have dessert. \n",

I'm sure others would love the place and the ambiance - but it certainly wasn't to our taste...\n",

The Codfish Fritters (daily special) were outstanding - best I’ve ever had. Very busy place, so go early.\n",

Special thanks to Ruel! Such a friendly and positive waiter. Ask his recommendations, every dish he suggested was absolutely fabulous. My top three:- cod with honey and tomatoes;- beef with foie gras;- camembert with almonds and berries.\n",

It was pretty packed outside and inside. Being there for the first time, we did not know where or how we could get into the queue for a table. Therefore went inside and was told off by the queue lady because we were standing on the wrong side of where we were supposed to be. Brushed that off as them being flustered due to the high number of customers but a bit of signage to let customers know where to queue would be helpful (and perhaps a little more service training for the queue lady would be awesome)Got in the queue, was told 30-45 mins. As there were a few customers in front that left, we promptly got a table. The waitress we had was patient and helpful with our orders. Food came out pretty quickly although there were some pretty hefty gaps between some orders (10-15 mins??)We tried re-ordering from a tall man with glasses but was told to “wait” and he never came back. He was constantly shaking his head at other customers after taking their orders so we took our next order with another server. Service was pretty patchy depending on which moody (or happy) person you got. Food highlights (we ordered 8 tapas for 2 people for €66.30 euro)- Cod with honey “allioli”- Beef tenderloin with foie gras- Crispy camembert- Shrimp “al ajillo”\n",

There was such a variety of great, authentic Spanish food and we enjoyed absolutely all of it! We came back two days in a row and would be glad to return again and again! Can’t wait for friends and family to visit Spain so we can show them some EXCELLENT food :P\n",

Best tapas- the filet with froe gras is the best I’ve ever had, grilled shrimp are delicious, and potatoes with aoli are heavenly. Reasonable prices on outstanding food, and good wine. Despite no reservations and long lines with typical waits of an hour at mealtime, it was totally worth the wait.\n",

Grilled clams and prawns are quite good. My favorite tapas here is grilled tenderloin with foie, which is very tasty.The service is so so because this is a very busy place. The waiter forgot one of my orders.\n",

Dinner services was average cause once we sit down we order a bottle of champagne. Lunch was in very poor services. Coffee waited for 20mins. Requested to order thought 4 staff still no one come. We tried to order signature grill octopus but the manager said only a word “no” till we saw other tables have it then another staff helped to order. What a service! Don’t understand why they need to provide such service as we are very polite. The key point is all food weren’t hot just a bit warm or even in room temperature.\n",

We went to quite a few tapas bars- each unique. But nothing compares to the variety, service, taste and ease of ordering for non- Spanish speakers. The restaurant was recommended (again) by locals who enjoy it tooThe fillet looked amazing but we weren’t in mood for meat.\n",

However, the tapas were very ordinary but the desserts stood out. In fact, the desserts were very impressive. I would say, just go for the foie gras with tenderloin tapas and the desserts (coconut pudding and the bread pudding!!)\n",

They make you feel at ease when you’re eating there and the Filipino servers do know how to suggest what tapas to have and drinks to take. The server Ruel at the bar really knows what’s the fresh catch of the day are so when you’re there for the first time try to seat at the bar. Definitely, it’s worth the experience.\n",

Great atmosphere and great service. Made our first night in Barcelona special. Yes a little on the expensive side but well worth it. Highly recommend \n",

We ordered quite a lot of different tapas and we weren’t disappointed with any of them. All delicious and tasty. I’m always surprised at how reasonable the costs are in restaurants in Barcelona. I find them much cheaper than UK restaurants. It was roughly €120 for 5 people - we must have had 10 tapas and a paella for 2 to share with a small jug of sangria, 2 beers and several cokes. Staff were attentive, friendly and accommodating. All round great experience.\n",

Maybe better less crowded options at same price point - not worth more than a ten minute wait - it’s just not\n",

I am glad to say it did not disappoint! Arriving with our tired 5 year old we were treated incredibly well and the lady at the front along with Ruel made a special effort to seat us quickly. Fortunately we got sat at the bar and Ruel made us feel very special right away, giving us tips on what we should try and being so attentive, it was like he could read our minds! All of the dishes we tried were incredible and we came away eating and drinking way more than we had originally planned. The ambience, level of service and quality of food made this one of our most memorable dining experiences ever - it was so good that we came back the next night and none of the magic was lost. It also said a lot that there were faces that we had seen the previous night who were there again also.To the owners - you are lucky to have such wonderful people working at your restaurant. Along with the incredible food that you serve, they make the whole experience first class. Ruel in particular is a huge asset and we loved the way he took care of us on both nights that we visited. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Barcelona!\n",

We had great seafood for our first visit: clams, scallops, fried small fish. When we came the second time, most seafood was run-out of stock: mussels, seafood plate ... We ended up having Spanish omelette and cod in honey sauce, which was not as tasty.\n",

Since we've planned on a big dinner, we only wanted to order a Tapa or two. Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese & Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.\n",

How? One waitress can change everything. He was not in the mood and affected our decisions. somehow we ordered something very weird. because of the language problems we didnt understand if we ordered something wrong or he didnt understand. \n",

I appreciate this and had a great experience. Food was amazing and would go back anytime I can.\n",

We ordered a couple of dishes, and expected a lot due to the reviews and recommendations from friends. All was amazing besides the razor clams, I expected a little more from the razor clams. People were nice, and our waiter was very knowledgeable. We will return again to give this another try.\n",

Stumbled upon this restaurant that had people spilling out the door. Good that I was solo because the helpful hostess and servers at the bar got me seated immediately and I was so glad because I was able to meet Ruel, William, Jordi and a younger, cute fellow who had nickname but I can’t recall if they told me his real name. Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable. Overall the food was great, the Sangria top notch but it was the service that really sold me on the tapas place. I really hope I have some time to stop by again before my trip ends but I will be sure to come back the next time in Barcelona!\n",

It's gotten a little touristy, but with patience you can find a table or a spot at the bar. You won't be disappointed by the quality, the variety and the prices of the tapas (i recommend shrimps). Also the sandwiches are really good.\n",

HOWEVER, this is a tourist trap, with the worst service ever. First of all, the server acted like he didn't even want to be here. Second of all, he had ZERO knowledge about hygiene and food safety. When he brought out the first tapa ( mushrooms w egg yolk ), his thumb was touching the rim of the plate and nail was touching the mushroom. By the third tapa, he looked at me as his thumb touched the tomato bread. And he handed me a new plate with grease on it. Thinking about all the germs he had in his nails... YUCK.\n",

The choice is enormous, every bite is heaven. And many people know this, and that is why this place during dinner times is absolutely loaded. The first time I had to come back for a table at 23:30 (thank god Barcelona had crazy dinner times). Normally between 16-17 in the afternoon you can find a place at the bar. Anyway, when in Barcelona, don't miss this place.\n",

Some dishes better than others. Very friendly service. Worth booking places in advance as there is a long line. We sat outside but it seems that the better atmosphere is inside... we could not wait for our turn :(...\n",

So after a long trip and an afternoon nap, this place was a great to taste several tapas, beer and wine. The razor clams are great among the other 10 tapas we tried. The nata dessert was also excellent and the service was great. \n",

Too bad we only went there on our last night in town. Good food, great service staff. They were lively and made good recommendation for us to try. Service was quick too and we didnt have to wait long for food. However, this place is popular so go early if you want a good table. we sat outside in the cold, which was fine. Overall love this place. will be back\n",

Thursday evening around six we were able to get a table immediately. Our server, Raquel, was very helpful explaining the differences between the tapas and mondtiditos. We ordered several items including sardines, crispy eggplant, mushrooms with asparagus codfish fritters and enjoyed everything. Two nites later we returned and Raquel remembered us. This time we tried garlic shrimp and a fried platter of squid, sardines and cuttlefish with mini poblanos plus a couple of “old favorites and a pitcher of sangria. Second dinner was even better and we then took Raquel’s dessert recommendation of bread pudding which is more of a soufflé with a creamy interior—scrumptious! Prices are very reasonable, service is quick and they are open from 9:30am to 1:30 am. If we return to Barcelona, we will return to Catalana\n",

You can’t make a reservation, but if you eat around 6:30-7:00 you shouldn’t have much of a wait. When we left at 9:30, the line was out the door. They have a regular menu and a specials menu. A couple of dishes we wanted from the specials menu were already sold out. We loved the razor clams, the burrata salad and the ham and cheese mini sandwich the best, but everything we tried was good. Make sure to save room for the burnt St Joan bread pudding. Service was friendly and very efficient. We would definitely return.\n",

First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.</td>\n",

Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!</td>\n",

How on earth can a restaurant like this have 4,5 with over 12 000 ratings. That is a mystery for me. The service was really a disgrace and the food was OK, nothing more. We were given a menu that was printed out on a paper and the printing black ink was faded on the menu so we couldn't read all of the menu and we couldn't see the prizes. When I told the waiter this he just showed me that all the menus were like that. Hahaha!And the dishes on the menu had no description so you had no idea what some of the stuff was or any sort of detail to it. There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it. We went away both hungry and just laughing at the entire experience. This was definitely our first and last time here.Spare your money and go to other restaurants that a actually great - there are plenty of them in Barcelona.</td>\n",

However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated.

When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling. At this time we couldnt stand the situation anymore and stood up to leave.

The ambience, level of service and quality of food made this one of our most memorable dining experiences ever - it was so good that we came back the next night and none of the magic was lost.

Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese &amp; Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.</td>\n",

Good that I was solo because the helpful hostess and servers at the bar got me seated immediately and I was so glad because I was able to meet Ruel, William, Jordi and a younger, cute fellow who had nickname but I can’t recall if they told me his real name. Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable. Overall the food was great, the Sangria top notch but it was the service that really sold me on the tapas place.

The garlic prawns with tomato bread were the best! I also had some ham/cheese tapas, a beer and finished with some churos. It was 25 euros so well worth it. Would definitely go back! The inside is more bright and modern than I was expecting but it had a nice atmosphere and great food.  \n",

High quality small dishes, with a very wide offer. It is always full, you need to queue. Go with plenty of time. The atmosphere is great, service is fast and prices are reasonable. You can have a taste of the local cuisine with several small dishes. You will not go there only once.  \n",

Very good place with quality food and very good treatment by the waiters. For dessert I ordered the crema catalana and it is the best I've ever tasted, it was only 2.95 euros, amazing!  \n",

Food comes very quickly, best to not order too much at the same time. Staff is friendly, however can appear a bit rushed as this place seems to have a waiting line outside most of the time. But really a must-try!  \n",

Me and my friend ordered a lot of things and we pay a very reasonable price. The service is also very good. I recommend it 100%.  \n",

We went back again to this restaurant a few days later and also one of it's sister restaurant Vinitus. :)  \n",

       "13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I was recommended this place for Tapas during TripAdvisor search. They don't do reservations but there is a waiting list outside. First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.  \n",

I went at the end of November with a colleague and they expanded the restaurant but the quality is still the same: Excellent!  \n",

They were very disorganized and look lost and desperate while taking care the long waiting line.The food is good but you can find other places better than this one in barcelona. I hope they can improve their service because the place is very nice.  \n",

The is absolutely the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona. The food is fantastic, the drinks and wine very good, and the overall experience is definitely value-for-money. The staff is very friendly and service minded. Its not possible to book a table, so I recommend come early or be prepared to wait for a while to be seated. Great Experience!  \n",

After all the waiting the waiter started to tell us off. What? Definitely not recommended. The system of listing people outside is a mess. They don’t do reservations and everyone is packed in the front of the restaurant. And the employees tell you off. Poor service.  \n",

IT WAS THAT GOOD. The front-of-house was really friendly and accommodating. There was a long line-up or queue but it was worth it! Raquel was our server and she was the best! She recommended a lot of their popular tapas, and they did not disappoint at all! It was so so good! The seafood was fresh and properly cooked, we had grilled figs that was so fresh, and mushrooms with egg yolk. It was all divine. Everything was served nice and hot. The garlic shrimp, galician clams, grilled cuttlefish, and many more, are definitely what to order. The staff was absolutely friendly.  \n",

We had a big table, they made us leave because someone else was coming. But in the same time they did not let us book a table earlier.   \n",

The food was fantastic - great quality, freshly cooked and quickly served. We had been told about this place by friends who had been before and it didn’t disappoint!You can’t book but you turn up and leave your name and they tell you roughly how long until your table is ready, so you can nip off for a drink nearby then come back, which is what we did. Our table was called promptly when we came back so we didn’t have to wait. It is always very busy so make sure you are there when your name is called as I would imagine they don’t hold tables for long!The service was impeccable and very quick. The place is very buzzing and full of atmosphere, so it was great fun - but not the place for a quiet, leisurely meal.

Each time we think of the city, this restaurant comes to mind first. The food is excellent and the best service.The staff are very nice. Price is reasonable. Yes, the line is often long but it's worth the wait. If/when we go back to Barcelona and this restaurant is the first stop!!  \n",

We waited about 25 minutes for a table at around 8.30pm on a Sunday evening. The staff were friendly, the restaurant was spotlessly clean and the food was excellent. The two of us shared some red prawns, razor clams, some beef and some whitebait, followed by a kind of bread pudding and churros, plus a jug of sangria. Everything was excellent.   \n",

What a fantastic find. Hugely popular, with quite a queue, but very well worth the wait. The razor clams were fabulous, as was the anchovy montadito, the croquettes, the burnt Sant Teresa torrija and the house chardonnay. Very reasonably priced. Sherwin (waiter) was excellent.  \n",

I ate around 13:30, so it may have been slow and too early, but everything just seemed slow and mediocre in the restaurant.I ordered 4 different types of tapas, and only liked 1 of the items.It's a very tourist-recommended location, but I'd suggest trying other local restaurants.  \n",

The Maitre d Rachez wasan incredible host. She made you feel great even if their was a wait. The food was incredible. We had multiple Shrimp types, Potatas Bravas, beef tenderloin, mini burgers, calamari, fist, etc. The sangria was to die for. One thing to note was that there were 3 other girls who waited on us - Cherry, Elsie, and Vangie. When the were not running plates, they were busy getting the place in order (moving plates, cleaning up, etc.) Thank you Girls - You run that joint. Overall, we loved it here and would go back again and again.  \n",

It has a good location, a buzz about it, and clearly has excellent word of mouth. We came a few years ago, and have just returned this weekend. Over the years we have recommended it to many people.You go outside, put your name on the list, get told your waiting time, and come back after having had a drink elsewhere. Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!  \n",

I want to share my disappointment with this place. They have bad service and terrible food. We ordered several tapas, but the waitress decided he was not going to place all the order. When we asked why he didn't bring all the order out he said then that we don't live in SLAVE time anymore. I was so surprised with his answer, so I requested to please speak with the manager. We found out he waa the manager. He moved on with screaming, yelling and behaving as a terrible person and forgot his service job. We left that place and will NEVER return. Don't waste your time and money place, find instead the other better tapas places in Barcelona.  \n",

It was our first time trying tapas and we weren’t sure what to order so the waiter ordered for us. All of his suggestions were finger-licking good, the dessert too! Will definitely be coming back more often.  \n",

Some of the dishes change daily, but we thought they were all great (some pictures attached). Our particular favourite was the cabreaos eggs (spicy eggs), which is a bit of a play on eggs and chips ( and like 6 euro !)We tried most of the menu, and particularly loved all the seafood (and the tomato bread !) We will DEFINITELY be coming back here when we return to Barcelona!  \n",

Expunge for the quality we’ve received. Also we ordered a dish saying salat included and it arrived without it.

The place is generally crowded and there is a long waiting line (I went a week ago and tables were very spaced out, more relaxed and we were admitted quickly, these changes are due to covid) despite this, IT IS AMAZING and very, very, very worth it. The food is beyond incredible and dinning is an experience, fast paced and with many tapas ordered, it is fun, enjoyable and very exciting. I will never stop recommending it for locals or tourists. I have heard immaculate reviews from others. Definitely go if you have the oportunity :)  \n",

This is the first time that I'm really suspicious to a rating on TripAdvisor. How on earth can a restaurant like this have 4,5 with over 12 000 ratings. That is a mystery for me. The service was really a disgrace and the food was OK, nothing more. We were given a menu that was printed out on a paper and the printing black ink was faded on the menu so we couldn't read all of the menu and we couldn't see the prizes. When I told the waiter this he just showed me that all the menus were like that. Hahaha!And the dishes on the menu had no description so you had no idea what some of the stuff was or any sort of detail to it. There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it. We went away both hungry and just laughing at the entire experience. This was definitely our first and last time here.Spare your money and go to other restaurants that a actually great - there are plenty of them in Barcelona.   \n",

So Very Uncool. Especially that they didnt even try to find us other solution.Positiv: -8pm we could get a table without waiting-2 delicious tapas: sirloin and potatoes with eggs (all other tapas we took was maximum average quality)I was expected much better from this many positive feedbacks but I wouldnt come back here to eat. It would have been nicer in a smaller bar or restaurant where they care about the costumers.  \n",

Great service, fast. I recommend to visit and try catalan cream, tomato bread, all tapas.  \n",

We ended up here for breakfast every day! Great, simple breakfast menu with fantastically reasonable prices! We had lunch here one day too but for us breakfast stole the show! Always busy so be prepared to wait a bit but it was worth it for us!  \n",

But if you don't present full they won't let you sit on the table.Totally absence of Customer centricity.I have already arranged a business meeting in that place otherwise I would spare my money there   \n",

Always a pleasure! Great local food, always fresh, always tasty. Each time we've tried something else in the menu.This time we've set on the bar and had a great \"closer\" service experience as well.Until next time....  \n",
       "53   I have been going to this restaurant ever since I arrived in Barcelona 2 years ago and have recommended it to many of my colleagues and friends. However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET ROBBED WHILE ENJOYING YOUR MEAL AND THEN TREATED LIKE YOU ARE A THIEF AND TOLD YOU MUST NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU PAY THEN GO AHEAD AND EAT HERE.  \n",

I visited this place for the first time 8 years ago and now the plates are much smaller and the prices much higher, so I was a bit dissapointed during my second visit :/  \n",

When he stopped because he couldn’t walk more (just for a minute or some seconds) they couldn’t stop telling me rudely to move him out of the way because he was “bothering”. I understand they need to walk fast without obstacles and everything, but he was just laying down and annoying nobody. Unless they can cure him I can’t do anything else apart from waiting, but it’s not necessary to be so rude for just a sick dog that can’t move and needs to rest.Never gonna eat there ever again.  \n",

Exactly what I was expecting from a local tapas place. Ok you have to wait 20min to get a table but don't give up.Menu: there are so many tapas that you can go crazy and order more than you can handle! My recommendation: Bacalau, Boquerones en vinagre and andaluze, NavajasPrice: in couple we totally spent 62eur for 12 tapas, 2 glasses of wine and bottle of water.We were full and satisfied.  \n",

Although we have been there twice without reservations, it’s recommended to make reservations ... or be lucky like we were.They have an elaborate selection of small (tapas) and main dishes, really allowing to satisfy each taste and preference.Service is efficient, fast and quite friendly.The quality of the food, the size of the portions and the presentation are proof of the professionalism of this place.Prices are midrange and ok for what you get.Will go back.  \n",

I wanted to experience for myself what he saw and tasted. My family and I walked twice towards this restaurant for dinner! Both times we came out very satisfied and happy. Food is here is very good brought to our table by a very friendly staff. Love the service here and price is reasonable. Don't think twice. Come here. Order grilled red prawns and steak with foie gras, among many other good things-you will be happy, promise!  \n",

Everything was amazing...the food, the service, and the atmosphere! The classic Spanish tapas like patatas bravas, pan con tomates, jamon iberico, and Spanish cheeses were wonderful as well as typical Catalan dishes like artichokes with shrimp and clams, fresh fried calamari, and crema catalana. Homemade sangria was perfect. Selection of wines by the glass was great. We will definitely be back here on our next trip. Best meal of the week in Barcelona!  \n",

It did not disappoint. Great energy, vibe and food was delicious. Try the skinny fries covered in an aioli with an egg on top. Sounds simple but was very tasty.   \n",

Arrived at about 8pm and were told there was a 30 minute wait for a table. After a drink at the bar we were called to our table after about 20 minutes. It was well worth the wait! Great food, great service and all reasonably priced. Very busy, great vibe/atmosphere, would go back again tomorrow if we could!!!!  \n",

Twice the wait was about an hour long and once 30 minutes. We saw large number of people waiting on all occasions.Having said all that, the food is quite good. We tried a variety of tapas on each occasions and most were quite tasty. Price was fairly reasonable to us too. milespointstravel.com  \n",

There was a short wait, but we were able to get seats the counter after just a few minutes. The service was prompt and professional. We enjoyed a liter of sangria with a steady flow of tapas. We tried many things, but especially enjoyed the garlic shrimp and the bombas - you definitely need to try the bombas! Would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona!  \n",

The food was ok, but not tasty. I don’t recommend.  \n",

The Tapas are very nice . Everything is very tasty and there is a big variety of fish food .The wine was also very nice and the desert . You can also sit at the bar to drink your wine or beer and eat a tapas. You need to reserve a table otherwise in rash hour you must wait more than an hour .   \n",

But it really worth it. The food is at very reasonable price and very tasty.  \n",

What an amazing meal. Came here on recommendation and did not disappoint. Busy packed place. Expect to wait for few minutes. Maybe if you sit at bar. Sat at bar and had front view of dishes tapas. Had 8 tapas. Steak to prawns to shrimp peppers to codfish the best. To more double takings. Amazing taste and affordable price. 9 tapas for 30 euros plus a beer. Not bad. Come here for a local busy pack place to eat and enjoy the crowd.   \n",

The tapas as amazing! Their options are reasonably priced for their serving, and everything was delicious. The server recommended Solomillo de ternera con foie (Beef tenderloin with foie gras) and it was an absolutely precious. The staff is super helpful and efficient, excellent service. I’d go back here. I will fly back to Barcelona to eat here. Expect a queue for dinner, but who can blame them? This is a great place!  \n",

The best we ever had in Spain. We ate there 7 times.Tried all seafood and mushrooms, even the potato and grilled peppers. All good.Wish they had a menu like in the Japanese restaurants with photos. I only know a limited Spanish. of course you can google the dishes and check what others order.  \n",

The prices are a bit expensive (2-4 euro for one open sandwich), but the food is seriously high quality. Definitely make a reservation as we came and it was packed out the front door. We were seated outside but still received pretty good and fast service, enough for my girlfriend and I to have enough time to hang out and chat over the food.  \n",

We made a reservation for 12 people, but at first we were in 11, waiting for one more to arrive. In the begining the waiters were already rude, but as we were there for a nice time with Friends, we didnt want to make a big thing from that. But the episodes started to occur, for instance, when one of the waiters complained because we were not ordering all the things for once (we were in a group of 11 and we were eating tapas, so no way everybody would order at the same time). When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling. At this time we couldnt stand the situation anymore and stood up to leave. The manager probably realized he and his team f***ed up and told us to stay because he was putting another chair for our friend. Too little too late. WORST EXPERIENCE IN A RESTAURANT IN MY WHOLE LIFE.  \n",

From the begging the waiters were very rude, throwing our orders at the table and putting very strange pressure for us to order fast and in the order they wanted. We had a table for 12 people but were 11. When our 12th friend arrived, they started saying it was not possible for him to sit and started counting the number of us, as if we would be cheating wrt the number of people!! We were consuming a lot and yet receiving awful service!Pathetic.  \n",

And by the time the 12th person arrive the staff did not get a chair for her. Believe or not the manager started to count the number of people.Terrible felling as tourist....  \n",

We went there for lunch and enjoyed everything we've ordered. A large selection of Tapas could be found here. we've tried Patatas Bravas, Foie Gras with tenderloin, Shrimp Skewers and many more.  The food was fantastic. We couldn't help but to come here again for dinner during our short stay in Barcelona. It is definitely our first choice when it comes to Tapas.  \n",

If you prefer o sit at the table, you have to wait. You can be lucky and get the place at bar, which is not a bad alternative at all.Food is amazingly taste. Really difficult to choose the best one. After eating of the first pieces, you will think to order all menu. Just go there and enjoy...  \n",

This place is very popular and very busy but is it the authentic Spanish tapas experience? I think not. Perhaps go here if you have a large group or you are on a bus tour. The atmosphere is loud, brightly lit and like that of a cafeteria (maybe a wee bit nicer). The quality of the food is fair but the staff are determined to get people in and out as quickly as they can. Prices are high. Credit to the staff who are working very hard.  \n",

I think the only difference is a slightly smaller wait time (5-10 minutes) and the name on the building. I love the tapas here. Try it all, you cannot go wrong. The albariño wines are my favorite and pair well with almost everything on the menu.  \n",

The waiter who served us was helpful, though his colleague spoke little English, and was extremely brisk.There was a large number of asian tourists here; not a bad thing, but indicative of the market it caters for and the price hike as a result.The food was uniformly excellent. The fried green peppers were an unexpected delight. If money is no object, then go crazy and I'm sure you'll have a ball.  \n",

Be there early to get a sit straight away and a good time to eat the menu ! Staff are all professional meaning they rush at 100 miles an hour to serve everyone . The food is fabulous. Have not had one bad dish .  \n",

Only down side is how crowded it gets at 20h onwards and the long waiting cue at dinner time.  \n",

The selection of tapas we ordered were all great and the portion was quite big. Service is great and most staff can speak English...  \n",

And I remember having to stand (for an hour) behind someone at the counter just to secure a narrow spot for myself.But the Philippino who served me was super nice (as our countries are neighbours ).Overall it was such a lovely time and of course the yummylicious food. I went back there again the next day with a friend and yep, we still had to wait for an hour but it was a pleasant experience ❤️  \n",

English speaking. No vegan options but for those without dietary concerns or budget issues this is a great place  \n",

Not anything amazing but make sure to try calcots (grilled leeks served with romesco sauce) if there in Winter. Staff were a little bit pushy in trying to get us to have dessert.   \n",

I'm sure others would love the place and the ambiance - but it certainly wasn't to our taste...  \n",

The Codfish Fritters (daily special) were outstanding - best I’ve ever had. Very busy place, so go early.  \n",

Special thanks to Ruel! Such a friendly and positive waiter. Ask his recommendations, every dish he suggested was absolutely fabulous. My top three:- cod with honey and tomatoes;- beef with foie gras;- camembert with almonds and berries.  \n",

It was pretty packed outside and inside. Being there for the first time, we did not know where or how we could get into the queue for a table. Therefore went inside and was told off by the queue lady because we were standing on the wrong side of where we were supposed to be. Brushed that off as them being flustered due to the high number of customers but a bit of signage to let customers know where to queue would be helpful (and perhaps a little more service training for the queue lady would be awesome)Got in the queue, was told 30-45 mins. As there were a few customers in front that left, we promptly got a table. The waitress we had was patient and helpful with our orders. Food came out pretty quickly although there were some pretty hefty gaps between some orders (10-15 mins??)We tried re-ordering from a tall man with glasses but was told to “wait” and he never came back. He was constantly shaking his head at other customers after taking their orders so we took our next order with another server. Service was pretty patchy depending on which moody (or happy) person you got. Food highlights (we ordered 8 tapas for 2 people for €66.30 euro)- Cod with honey “allioli”- Beef tenderloin with foie gras- Crispy camembert- Shrimp “al ajillo”  \n",

There was such a variety of great, authentic Spanish food and we enjoyed absolutely all of it! We came back two days in a row and would be glad to return again and again! Can’t wait for friends and family to visit Spain so we can show them some EXCELLENT food :P  \n",

Best tapas- the filet with froe gras is the best I’ve ever had, grilled shrimp are delicious, and potatoes with aoli are heavenly. Reasonable prices on outstanding food, and good wine. Despite no reservations and long lines with typical waits of an hour at mealtime, it was totally worth the wait.  \n",

Grilled clams and prawns are quite good. My favorite tapas here is grilled tenderloin with foie, which is very tasty.The service is so so because this is a very busy place. The waiter forgot one of my orders.  \n",

Dinner services was average cause once we sit down we order a bottle of champagne. Lunch was in very poor services. Coffee waited for 20mins. Requested to order thought 4 staff still no one come. We tried to order signature grill octopus but the manager said only a word “no” till we saw other tables have it then another staff helped to order. What a service! Don’t understand why they need to provide such service as we are very polite. The key point is all food weren’t hot just a bit warm or even in room temperature.  \n",

We went to quite a few tapas bars- each unique. But nothing compares to the variety, service, taste and ease of ordering for non- Spanish speakers. The restaurant was recommended (again) by locals who enjoy it tooThe fillet looked amazing but we weren’t in mood for meat.  \n",

However, the tapas were very ordinary but the desserts stood out. In fact, the desserts were very impressive. I would say, just go for the foie gras with tenderloin tapas and the desserts (coconut pudding and the bread pudding!!)  \n",

They make you feel at ease when you’re eating there and the Filipino servers do know how to suggest what tapas to have and drinks to take. The server Ruel at the bar really knows what’s the fresh catch of the day are so when you’re there for the first time try to seat at the bar. Definitely, it’s worth the experience.  \n",

Great atmosphere and great service. Made our first night in Barcelona special. Yes a little on the expensive side but well worth it. Highly recommend   \n",

We ordered quite a lot of different tapas and we weren’t disappointed with any of them. All delicious and tasty. I’m always surprised at how reasonable the costs are in restaurants in Barcelona. I find them much cheaper than UK restaurants. It was roughly €120 for 5 people - we must have had 10 tapas and a paella for 2 to share with a small jug of sangria, 2 beers and several cokes. Staff were attentive, friendly and accommodating. All round great experience.  \n",

Maybe better less crowded options at same price point - not worth more than a ten minute wait - it’s just not  \n",

I am glad to say it did not disappoint! Arriving with our tired 5 year old we were treated incredibly well and the lady at the front along with Ruel made a special effort to seat us quickly. Fortunately we got sat at the bar and Ruel made us feel very special right away, giving us tips on what we should try and being so attentive, it was like he could read our minds! All of the dishes we tried were incredible and we came away eating and drinking way more than we had originally planned. The ambience, level of service and quality of food made this one of our most memorable dining experiences ever - it was so good that we came back the next night and none of the magic was lost. It also said a lot that there were faces that we had seen the previous night who were there again also.To the owners - you are lucky to have such wonderful people working at your restaurant. Along with the incredible food that you serve, they make the whole experience first class. Ruel in particular is a huge asset and we loved the way he took care of us on both nights that we visited. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Barcelona!  \n",

We had great seafood for our first visit: clams, scallops, fried small fish. When we came the second time, most seafood was run-out of stock: mussels, seafood plate ... We ended up having Spanish omelette and cod in honey sauce, which was not as tasty.  \n",

Since we've planned on a big dinner, we only wanted to order a Tapa or two. Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese & Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.  \n",

How? One waitress can change everything. He was not in the mood and affected our decisions. somehow we ordered something very weird. because of the language problems we didnt understand if we ordered something wrong or he didnt understand.   \n",

I appreciate this and had a great experience. Food was amazing and would go back anytime I can.  \n",

We ordered a couple of dishes, and expected a lot due to the reviews and recommendations from friends. All was amazing besides the razor clams, I expected a little more from the razor clams. People were nice, and our waiter was very knowledgeable. We will return again to give this another try.  \n",

Stumbled upon this restaurant that had people spilling out the door. Good that I was solo because the helpful hostess and servers at the bar got me seated immediately and I was so glad because I was able to meet Ruel, William, Jordi and a younger, cute fellow who had nickname but I can’t recall if they told me his real name. Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable. Overall the food was great, the Sangria top notch but it was the service that really sold me on the tapas place. I really hope I have some time to stop by again before my trip ends but I will be sure to come back the next time in Barcelona!  \n",

It's gotten a little touristy, but with patience you can find a table or a spot at the bar. You won't be disappointed by the quality, the variety and the prices of the tapas (i recommend shrimps). Also the sandwiches are really good.  \n",

HOWEVER, this is a tourist trap, with the worst service ever. First of all, the server acted like he didn't even want to be here. Second of all, he had ZERO knowledge about hygiene and food safety. When he brought out the first tapa ( mushrooms w egg yolk ), his thumb was touching the rim of the plate and nail was touching the mushroom. By the third tapa, he looked at me as his thumb touched the tomato bread. And he handed me a new plate with grease on it. Thinking about all the germs he had in his nails... YUCK.  \n",

The choice is enormous, every bite is heaven. And many people know this, and that is why this place during dinner times is absolutely loaded. The first time I had to come back for a table at 23:30 (thank god Barcelona had crazy dinner times). Normally between 16-17 in the afternoon you can find a place at the bar. Anyway, when in Barcelona, don't miss this place.  \n",

Some dishes better than others. Very friendly service. Worth booking places in advance as there is a long line. We sat outside but it seems that the better atmosphere is inside... we could not wait for our turn :(...  \n",

So after a long trip and an afternoon nap, this place was a great to taste several tapas, beer and wine. The razor clams are great among the other 10 tapas we tried. The nata dessert was also excellent and the service was great.   \n",

Too bad we only went there on our last night in town. Good food, great service staff. They were lively and made good recommendation for us to try. Service was quick too and we didnt have to wait long for food. However, this place is popular so go early if you want a good table. we sat outside in the cold, which was fine. Overall love this place. will be back  \n",

Thursday evening around six we were able to get a table immediately. Our server, Raquel, was very helpful explaining the differences between the tapas and mondtiditos. We ordered several items including sardines, crispy eggplant, mushrooms with asparagus codfish fritters and enjoyed everything. Two nites later we returned and Raquel remembered us. This time we tried garlic shrimp and a fried platter of squid, sardines and cuttlefish with mini poblanos plus a couple of “old favorites and a pitcher of sangria. Second dinner was even better and we then took Raquel’s dessert recommendation of bread pudding which is more of a soufflé with a creamy interior—scrumptious! Prices are very reasonable, service is quick and they are open from 9:30am to 1:30 am. If we return to Barcelona, we will return to Catalana  \n",

You can’t make a reservation, but if you eat around 6:30-7:00 you shouldn’t have much of a wait. When we left at 9:30, the line was out the door. They have a regular menu and a specials menu. A couple of dishes we wanted from the specials menu were already sold out. We loved the razor clams, the burrata salad and the ham and cheese mini sandwich the best, but everything we tried was good. Make sure to save room for the burnt St Joan bread pudding. Service was friendly and very efficient. We would definitely return.  \n",

First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.</td>\n",

Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!</td>\n",

There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it.

I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated.

When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces.

But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling.

The ambience, level of service and quality of food made this one of our most memorable dining experiences ever - it was so good that we came back the next night and none of the magic was lost.

Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese &amp; Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.</td>\n",

Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable.

The garlic prawns with tomato bread were the best! I also had some ham/cheese tapas, a beer and finished with some churos. It was 25 euros so well worth it. Would definitely go back! The inside is more bright and modern than I was expecting but it had a nice atmosphere and great food.  \n",

High quality small dishes, with a very wide offer. It is always full, you need to queue. Go with plenty of time. The atmosphere is great, service is fast and prices are reasonable. You can have a taste of the local cuisine with several small dishes. You will not go there only once.  \n",

Very good place with quality food and very good treatment by the waiters. For dessert I ordered the crema catalana and it is the best I've ever tasted, it was only 2.95 euros, amazing!  \n",

Food comes very quickly, best to not order too much at the same time. Staff is friendly, however can appear a bit rushed as this place seems to have a waiting line outside most of the time. But really a must-try!  \n",

Me and my friend ordered a lot of things and we pay a very reasonable price. The service is also very good. I recommend it 100%.  \n",

We went back again to this restaurant a few days later and also one of it's sister restaurant Vinitus. :)  \n",

       "13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I was recommended this place for Tapas during TripAdvisor search. They don't do reservations but there is a waiting list outside. First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.  \n",

I went at the end of November with a colleague and they expanded the restaurant but the quality is still the same: Excellent!  \n",

They were very disorganized and look lost and desperate while taking care the long waiting line.The food is good but you can find other places better than this one in barcelona. I hope they can improve their service because the place is very nice.  \n",

The is absolutely the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona. The food is fantastic, the drinks and wine very good, and the overall experience is definitely value-for-money. The staff is very friendly and service minded. Its not possible to book a table, so I recommend come early or be prepared to wait for a while to be seated. Great Experience!  \n",

After all the waiting the waiter started to tell us off. What? Definitely not recommended. The system of listing people outside is a mess. They don’t do reservations and everyone is packed in the front of the restaurant. And the employees tell you off. Poor service.  \n",

IT WAS THAT GOOD. The front-of-house was really friendly and accommodating. There was a long line-up or queue but it was worth it! Raquel was our server and she was the best! She recommended a lot of their popular tapas, and they did not disappoint at all! It was so so good! The seafood was fresh and properly cooked, we had grilled figs that was so fresh, and mushrooms with egg yolk. It was all divine. Everything was served nice and hot. The garlic shrimp, galician clams, grilled cuttlefish, and many more, are definitely what to order. The staff was absolutely friendly.  \n",

We had a big table, they made us leave because someone else was coming. But in the same time they did not let us book a table earlier.   \n",

The food was fantastic - great quality, freshly cooked and quickly served. We had been told about this place by friends who had been before and it didn’t disappoint!You can’t book but you turn up and leave your name and they tell you roughly how long until your table is ready, so you can nip off for a drink nearby then come back, which is what we did. Our table was called promptly when we came back so we didn’t have to wait. It is always very busy so make sure you are there when your name is called as I would imagine they don’t hold tables for long!The service was impeccable and very quick. The place is very buzzing and full of atmosphere, so it was great fun - but not the place for a quiet, leisurely meal.

Each time we think of the city, this restaurant comes to mind first. The food is excellent and the best service.The staff are very nice. Price is reasonable. Yes, the line is often long but it's worth the wait. If/when we go back to Barcelona and this restaurant is the first stop!!  \n",

We waited about 25 minutes for a table at around 8.30pm on a Sunday evening. The staff were friendly, the restaurant was spotlessly clean and the food was excellent. The two of us shared some red prawns, razor clams, some beef and some whitebait, followed by a kind of bread pudding and churros, plus a jug of sangria. Everything was excellent.   \n",

What a fantastic find. Hugely popular, with quite a queue, but very well worth the wait. The razor clams were fabulous, as was the anchovy montadito, the croquettes, the burnt Sant Teresa torrija and the house chardonnay. Very reasonably priced. Sherwin (waiter) was excellent.  \n",

I ate around 13:30, so it may have been slow and too early, but everything just seemed slow and mediocre in the restaurant.I ordered 4 different types of tapas, and only liked 1 of the items.It's a very tourist-recommended location, but I'd suggest trying other local restaurants.  \n",

The Maitre d Rachez wasan incredible host. She made you feel great even if their was a wait. The food was incredible. We had multiple Shrimp types, Potatas Bravas, beef tenderloin, mini burgers, calamari, fist, etc. The sangria was to die for. One thing to note was that there were 3 other girls who waited on us - Cherry, Elsie, and Vangie. When the were not running plates, they were busy getting the place in order (moving plates, cleaning up, etc.) Thank you Girls - You run that joint. Overall, we loved it here and would go back again and again.  \n",

It has a good location, a buzz about it, and clearly has excellent word of mouth. We came a few years ago, and have just returned this weekend. Over the years we have recommended it to many people.You go outside, put your name on the list, get told your waiting time, and come back after having had a drink elsewhere. Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!  \n",

I want to share my disappointment with this place. They have bad service and terrible food. We ordered several tapas, but the waitress decided he was not going to place all the order. When we asked why he didn't bring all the order out he said then that we don't live in SLAVE time anymore. I was so surprised with his answer, so I requested to please speak with the manager. We found out he waa the manager. He moved on with screaming, yelling and behaving as a terrible person and forgot his service job. We left that place and will NEVER return. Don't waste your time and money place, find instead the other better tapas places in Barcelona.  \n",

It was our first time trying tapas and we weren’t sure what to order so the waiter ordered for us. All of his suggestions were finger-licking good, the dessert too! Will definitely be coming back more often.  \n",

Some of the dishes change daily, but we thought they were all great (some pictures attached). Our particular favourite was the cabreaos eggs (spicy eggs), which is a bit of a play on eggs and chips ( and like 6 euro !)We tried most of the menu, and particularly loved all the seafood (and the tomato bread !) We will DEFINITELY be coming back here when we return to Barcelona!  \n",

Expunge for the quality we’ve received. Also we ordered a dish saying salat included and it arrived without it.

The place is generally crowded and there is a long waiting line (I went a week ago and tables were very spaced out, more relaxed and we were admitted quickly, these changes are due to covid) despite this, IT IS AMAZING and very, very, very worth it. The food is beyond incredible and dinning is an experience, fast paced and with many tapas ordered, it is fun, enjoyable and very exciting. I will never stop recommending it for locals or tourists. I have heard immaculate reviews from others. Definitely go if you have the oportunity :)  \n",

This is the first time that I'm really suspicious to a rating on TripAdvisor. How on earth can a restaurant like this have 4,5 with over 12 000 ratings. That is a mystery for me. The service was really a disgrace and the food was OK, nothing more. We were given a menu that was printed out on a paper and the printing black ink was faded on the menu so we couldn't read all of the menu and we couldn't see the prizes. When I told the waiter this he just showed me that all the menus were like that. Hahaha!And the dishes on the menu had no description so you had no idea what some of the stuff was or any sort of detail to it. There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it. We went away both hungry and just laughing at the entire experience. This was definitely our first and last time here.Spare your money and go to other restaurants that a actually great - there are plenty of them in Barcelona.   \n",

So Very Uncool. Especially that they didnt even try to find us other solution.Positiv: -8pm we could get a table without waiting-2 delicious tapas: sirloin and potatoes with eggs (all other tapas we took was maximum average quality)I was expected much better from this many positive feedbacks but I wouldnt come back here to eat. It would have been nicer in a smaller bar or restaurant where they care about the costumers.  \n",

Great service, fast. I recommend to visit and try catalan cream, tomato bread, all tapas.  \n",

We ended up here for breakfast every day! Great, simple breakfast menu with fantastically reasonable prices! We had lunch here one day too but for us breakfast stole the show! Always busy so be prepared to wait a bit but it was worth it for us!  \n",

But if you don't present full they won't let you sit on the table.Totally absence of Customer centricity.I have already arranged a business meeting in that place otherwise I would spare my money there   \n",

Always a pleasure! Great local food, always fresh, always tasty. Each time we've tried something else in the menu.This time we've set on the bar and had a great \"closer\" service experience as well.Until next time....  \n",
       "53   I have been going to this restaurant ever since I arrived in Barcelona 2 years ago and have recommended it to many of my colleagues and friends. However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET ROBBED WHILE ENJOYING YOUR MEAL AND THEN TREATED LIKE YOU ARE A THIEF AND TOLD YOU MUST NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU PAY THEN GO AHEAD AND EAT HERE.  \n",

I visited this place for the first time 8 years ago and now the plates are much smaller and the prices much higher, so I was a bit dissapointed during my second visit :/  \n",

When he stopped because he couldn’t walk more (just for a minute or some seconds) they couldn’t stop telling me rudely to move him out of the way because he was “bothering”. I understand they need to walk fast without obstacles and everything, but he was just laying down and annoying nobody. Unless they can cure him I can’t do anything else apart from waiting, but it’s not necessary to be so rude for just a sick dog that can’t move and needs to rest.Never gonna eat there ever again.  \n",

Exactly what I was expecting from a local tapas place. Ok you have to wait 20min to get a table but don't give up.Menu: there are so many tapas that you can go crazy and order more than you can handle! My recommendation: Bacalau, Boquerones en vinagre and andaluze, NavajasPrice: in couple we totally spent 62eur for 12 tapas, 2 glasses of wine and bottle of water.We were full and satisfied.  \n",

Although we have been there twice without reservations, it’s recommended to make reservations ... or be lucky like we were.They have an elaborate selection of small (tapas) and main dishes, really allowing to satisfy each taste and preference.Service is efficient, fast and quite friendly.The quality of the food, the size of the portions and the presentation are proof of the professionalism of this place.Prices are midrange and ok for what you get.Will go back.  \n",

I wanted to experience for myself what he saw and tasted. My family and I walked twice towards this restaurant for dinner! Both times we came out very satisfied and happy. Food is here is very good brought to our table by a very friendly staff. Love the service here and price is reasonable. Don't think twice. Come here. Order grilled red prawns and steak with foie gras, among many other good things-you will be happy, promise!  \n",

Everything was amazing...the food, the service, and the atmosphere! The classic Spanish tapas like patatas bravas, pan con tomates, jamon iberico, and Spanish cheeses were wonderful as well as typical Catalan dishes like artichokes with shrimp and clams, fresh fried calamari, and crema catalana. Homemade sangria was perfect. Selection of wines by the glass was great. We will definitely be back here on our next trip. Best meal of the week in Barcelona!  \n",

It did not disappoint. Great energy, vibe and food was delicious. Try the skinny fries covered in an aioli with an egg on top. Sounds simple but was very tasty.   \n",

Arrived at about 8pm and were told there was a 30 minute wait for a table. After a drink at the bar we were called to our table after about 20 minutes. It was well worth the wait! Great food, great service and all reasonably priced. Very busy, great vibe/atmosphere, would go back again tomorrow if we could!!!!  \n",

Twice the wait was about an hour long and once 30 minutes. We saw large number of people waiting on all occasions.Having said all that, the food is quite good. We tried a variety of tapas on each occasions and most were quite tasty. Price was fairly reasonable to us too. milespointstravel.com  \n",

There was a short wait, but we were able to get seats the counter after just a few minutes. The service was prompt and professional. We enjoyed a liter of sangria with a steady flow of tapas. We tried many things, but especially enjoyed the garlic shrimp and the bombas - you definitely need to try the bombas! Would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona!  \n",

The food was ok, but not tasty. I don’t recommend.  \n",

The Tapas are very nice . Everything is very tasty and there is a big variety of fish food .The wine was also very nice and the desert . You can also sit at the bar to drink your wine or beer and eat a tapas. You need to reserve a table otherwise in rash hour you must wait more than an hour .   \n",

But it really worth it. The food is at very reasonable price and very tasty.  \n",

What an amazing meal. Came here on recommendation and did not disappoint. Busy packed place. Expect to wait for few minutes. Maybe if you sit at bar. Sat at bar and had front view of dishes tapas. Had 8 tapas. Steak to prawns to shrimp peppers to codfish the best. To more double takings. Amazing taste and affordable price. 9 tapas for 30 euros plus a beer. Not bad. Come here for a local busy pack place to eat and enjoy the crowd.   \n",

The tapas as amazing! Their options are reasonably priced for their serving, and everything was delicious. The server recommended Solomillo de ternera con foie (Beef tenderloin with foie gras) and it was an absolutely precious. The staff is super helpful and efficient, excellent service. I’d go back here. I will fly back to Barcelona to eat here. Expect a queue for dinner, but who can blame them? This is a great place!  \n",

The best we ever had in Spain. We ate there 7 times.Tried all seafood and mushrooms, even the potato and grilled peppers. All good.Wish they had a menu like in the Japanese restaurants with photos. I only know a limited Spanish. of course you can google the dishes and check what others order.  \n",

The prices are a bit expensive (2-4 euro for one open sandwich), but the food is seriously high quality. Definitely make a reservation as we came and it was packed out the front door. We were seated outside but still received pretty good and fast service, enough for my girlfriend and I to have enough time to hang out and chat over the food.  \n",

We made a reservation for 12 people, but at first we were in 11, waiting for one more to arrive. In the begining the waiters were already rude, but as we were there for a nice time with Friends, we didnt want to make a big thing from that. But the episodes started to occur, for instance, when one of the waiters complained because we were not ordering all the things for once (we were in a group of 11 and we were eating tapas, so no way everybody would order at the same time). When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling. At this time we couldnt stand the situation anymore and stood up to leave. The manager probably realized he and his team f***ed up and told us to stay because he was putting another chair for our friend. Too little too late. WORST EXPERIENCE IN A RESTAURANT IN MY WHOLE LIFE.  \n",

From the begging the waiters were very rude, throwing our orders at the table and putting very strange pressure for us to order fast and in the order they wanted. We had a table for 12 people but were 11. When our 12th friend arrived, they started saying it was not possible for him to sit and started counting the number of us, as if we would be cheating wrt the number of people!! We were consuming a lot and yet receiving awful service!Pathetic.  \n",

And by the time the 12th person arrive the staff did not get a chair for her. Believe or not the manager started to count the number of people.Terrible felling as tourist....  \n",

We went there for lunch and enjoyed everything we've ordered. A large selection of Tapas could be found here. we've tried Patatas Bravas, Foie Gras with tenderloin, Shrimp Skewers and many more.  The food was fantastic. We couldn't help but to come here again for dinner during our short stay in Barcelona. It is definitely our first choice when it comes to Tapas.  \n",

If you prefer o sit at the table, you have to wait. You can be lucky and get the place at bar, which is not a bad alternative at all.Food is amazingly taste. Really difficult to choose the best one. After eating of the first pieces, you will think to order all menu. Just go there and enjoy...  \n",

This place is very popular and very busy but is it the authentic Spanish tapas experience? I think not. Perhaps go here if you have a large group or you are on a bus tour. The atmosphere is loud, brightly lit and like that of a cafeteria (maybe a wee bit nicer). The quality of the food is fair but the staff are determined to get people in and out as quickly as they can. Prices are high. Credit to the staff who are working very hard.  \n",

I think the only difference is a slightly smaller wait time (5-10 minutes) and the name on the building. I love the tapas here. Try it all, you cannot go wrong. The albariño wines are my favorite and pair well with almost everything on the menu.  \n",

The waiter who served us was helpful, though his colleague spoke little English, and was extremely brisk.There was a large number of asian tourists here; not a bad thing, but indicative of the market it caters for and the price hike as a result.The food was uniformly excellent. The fried green peppers were an unexpected delight. If money is no object, then go crazy and I'm sure you'll have a ball.  \n",

Be there early to get a sit straight away and a good time to eat the menu ! Staff are all professional meaning they rush at 100 miles an hour to serve everyone . The food is fabulous. Have not had one bad dish .  \n",

Only down side is how crowded it gets at 20h onwards and the long waiting cue at dinner time.  \n",

The selection of tapas we ordered were all great and the portion was quite big. Service is great and most staff can speak English...  \n",

And I remember having to stand (for an hour) behind someone at the counter just to secure a narrow spot for myself.But the Philippino who served me was super nice (as our countries are neighbours ).Overall it was such a lovely time and of course the yummylicious food. I went back there again the next day with a friend and yep, we still had to wait for an hour but it was a pleasant experience ❤️  \n",

English speaking. No vegan options but for those without dietary concerns or budget issues this is a great place  \n",

Not anything amazing but make sure to try calcots (grilled leeks served with romesco sauce) if there in Winter. Staff were a little bit pushy in trying to get us to have dessert.   \n",

I'm sure others would love the place and the ambiance - but it certainly wasn't to our taste...  \n",

The Codfish Fritters (daily special) were outstanding - best I’ve ever had. Very busy place, so go early.  \n",

Special thanks to Ruel! Such a friendly and positive waiter. Ask his recommendations, every dish he suggested was absolutely fabulous. My top three:- cod with honey and tomatoes;- beef with foie gras;- camembert with almonds and berries.  \n",

It was pretty packed outside and inside. Being there for the first time, we did not know where or how we could get into the queue for a table. Therefore went inside and was told off by the queue lady because we were standing on the wrong side of where we were supposed to be. Brushed that off as them being flustered due to the high number of customers but a bit of signage to let customers know where to queue would be helpful (and perhaps a little more service training for the queue lady would be awesome)Got in the queue, was told 30-45 mins. As there were a few customers in front that left, we promptly got a table. The waitress we had was patient and helpful with our orders. Food came out pretty quickly although there were some pretty hefty gaps between some orders (10-15 mins??)We tried re-ordering from a tall man with glasses but was told to “wait” and he never came back. He was constantly shaking his head at other customers after taking their orders so we took our next order with another server. Service was pretty patchy depending on which moody (or happy) person you got. Food highlights (we ordered 8 tapas for 2 people for €66.30 euro)- Cod with honey “allioli”- Beef tenderloin with foie gras- Crispy camembert- Shrimp “al ajillo”  \n",

There was such a variety of great, authentic Spanish food and we enjoyed absolutely all of it! We came back two days in a row and would be glad to return again and again! Can’t wait for friends and family to visit Spain so we can show them some EXCELLENT food :P  \n",

Best tapas- the filet with froe gras is the best I’ve ever had, grilled shrimp are delicious, and potatoes with aoli are heavenly. Reasonable prices on outstanding food, and good wine. Despite no reservations and long lines with typical waits of an hour at mealtime, it was totally worth the wait.  \n",

Grilled clams and prawns are quite good. My favorite tapas here is grilled tenderloin with foie, which is very tasty.The service is so so because this is a very busy place. The waiter forgot one of my orders.  \n",

Dinner services was average cause once we sit down we order a bottle of champagne. Lunch was in very poor services. Coffee waited for 20mins. Requested to order thought 4 staff still no one come. We tried to order signature grill octopus but the manager said only a word “no” till we saw other tables have it then another staff helped to order. What a service! Don’t understand why they need to provide such service as we are very polite. The key point is all food weren’t hot just a bit warm or even in room temperature.  \n",

We went to quite a few tapas bars- each unique. But nothing compares to the variety, service, taste and ease of ordering for non- Spanish speakers. The restaurant was recommended (again) by locals who enjoy it tooThe fillet looked amazing but we weren’t in mood for meat.  \n",

However, the tapas were very ordinary but the desserts stood out. In fact, the desserts were very impressive. I would say, just go for the foie gras with tenderloin tapas and the desserts (coconut pudding and the bread pudding!!)  \n",

They make you feel at ease when you’re eating there and the Filipino servers do know how to suggest what tapas to have and drinks to take. The server Ruel at the bar really knows what’s the fresh catch of the day are so when you’re there for the first time try to seat at the bar. Definitely, it’s worth the experience.  \n",

Great atmosphere and great service. Made our first night in Barcelona special. Yes a little on the expensive side but well worth it. Highly recommend   \n",

We ordered quite a lot of different tapas and we weren’t disappointed with any of them. All delicious and tasty. I’m always surprised at how reasonable the costs are in restaurants in Barcelona. I find them much cheaper than UK restaurants. It was roughly €120 for 5 people - we must have had 10 tapas and a paella for 2 to share with a small jug of sangria, 2 beers and several cokes. Staff were attentive, friendly and accommodating. All round great experience.  \n",

Maybe better less crowded options at same price point - not worth more than a ten minute wait - it’s just not  \n",

I am glad to say it did not disappoint! Arriving with our tired 5 year old we were treated incredibly well and the lady at the front along with Ruel made a special effort to seat us quickly. Fortunately we got sat at the bar and Ruel made us feel very special right away, giving us tips on what we should try and being so attentive, it was like he could read our minds! All of the dishes we tried were incredible and we came away eating and drinking way more than we had originally planned. The ambience, level of service and quality of food made this one of our most memorable dining experiences ever - it was so good that we came back the next night and none of the magic was lost. It also said a lot that there were faces that we had seen the previous night who were there again also.To the owners - you are lucky to have such wonderful people working at your restaurant. Along with the incredible food that you serve, they make the whole experience first class. Ruel in particular is a huge asset and we loved the way he took care of us on both nights that we visited. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Barcelona!  \n",

We had great seafood for our first visit: clams, scallops, fried small fish. When we came the second time, most seafood was run-out of stock: mussels, seafood plate ... We ended up having Spanish omelette and cod in honey sauce, which was not as tasty.  \n",

Since we've planned on a big dinner, we only wanted to order a Tapa or two. Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese & Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.  \n",

How? One waitress can change everything. He was not in the mood and affected our decisions. somehow we ordered something very weird. because of the language problems we didnt understand if we ordered something wrong or he didnt understand.   \n",

I appreciate this and had a great experience. Food was amazing and would go back anytime I can.  \n",

We ordered a couple of dishes, and expected a lot due to the reviews and recommendations from friends. All was amazing besides the razor clams, I expected a little more from the razor clams. People were nice, and our waiter was very knowledgeable. We will return again to give this another try.  \n",

Stumbled upon this restaurant that had people spilling out the door. Good that I was solo because the helpful hostess and servers at the bar got me seated immediately and I was so glad because I was able to meet Ruel, William, Jordi and a younger, cute fellow who had nickname but I can’t recall if they told me his real name. Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable. Overall the food was great, the Sangria top notch but it was the service that really sold me on the tapas place. I really hope I have some time to stop by again before my trip ends but I will be sure to come back the next time in Barcelona!  \n",

It's gotten a little touristy, but with patience you can find a table or a spot at the bar. You won't be disappointed by the quality, the variety and the prices of the tapas (i recommend shrimps). Also the sandwiches are really good.  \n",

HOWEVER, this is a tourist trap, with the worst service ever. First of all, the server acted like he didn't even want to be here. Second of all, he had ZERO knowledge about hygiene and food safety. When he brought out the first tapa ( mushrooms w egg yolk ), his thumb was touching the rim of the plate and nail was touching the mushroom. By the third tapa, he looked at me as his thumb touched the tomato bread. And he handed me a new plate with grease on it. Thinking about all the germs he had in his nails... YUCK.  \n",

The choice is enormous, every bite is heaven. And many people know this, and that is why this place during dinner times is absolutely loaded. The first time I had to come back for a table at 23:30 (thank god Barcelona had crazy dinner times). Normally between 16-17 in the afternoon you can find a place at the bar. Anyway, when in Barcelona, don't miss this place.  \n",

Some dishes better than others. Very friendly service. Worth booking places in advance as there is a long line. We sat outside but it seems that the better atmosphere is inside... we could not wait for our turn :(...  \n",

So after a long trip and an afternoon nap, this place was a great to taste several tapas, beer and wine. The razor clams are great among the other 10 tapas we tried. The nata dessert was also excellent and the service was great.   \n",

Too bad we only went there on our last night in town. Good food, great service staff. They were lively and made good recommendation for us to try. Service was quick too and we didnt have to wait long for food. However, this place is popular so go early if you want a good table. we sat outside in the cold, which was fine. Overall love this place. will be back  \n",

Thursday evening around six we were able to get a table immediately. Our server, Raquel, was very helpful explaining the differences between the tapas and mondtiditos. We ordered several items including sardines, crispy eggplant, mushrooms with asparagus codfish fritters and enjoyed everything. Two nites later we returned and Raquel remembered us. This time we tried garlic shrimp and a fried platter of squid, sardines and cuttlefish with mini poblanos plus a couple of “old favorites and a pitcher of sangria. Second dinner was even better and we then took Raquel’s dessert recommendation of bread pudding which is more of a soufflé with a creamy interior—scrumptious! Prices are very reasonable, service is quick and they are open from 9:30am to 1:30 am. If we return to Barcelona, we will return to Catalana  \n",

You can’t make a reservation, but if you eat around 6:30-7:00 you shouldn’t have much of a wait. When we left at 9:30, the line was out the door. They have a regular menu and a specials menu. A couple of dishes we wanted from the specials menu were already sold out. We loved the razor clams, the burrata salad and the ham and cheese mini sandwich the best, but everything we tried was good. Make sure to save room for the burnt St Joan bread pudding. Service was friendly and very efficient. We would definitely return.  \n",

First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.</td>\n",

Our table was called promptly when we came back so we didn’t have to wait. It is always very busy so make sure you are there when your name is called as I would imagine they don’t hold tables for long!The service was impeccable and very quick.

The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!</td>\n",

There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it.

I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated.

Everything was amazing...the food, the service, and the atmosphere! The classic Spanish tapas like patatas bravas, pan con tomates, jamon iberico, and Spanish cheeses were wonderful as well as typical Catalan dishes like artichokes with shrimp and clams, fresh fried calamari, and crema catalana. Homemade sangria was perfect. Selection of wines by the glass was great. We will definitely be back here on our next trip. Best meal of the week in Barcelona!</td>\n",

When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling.

Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese &amp; Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.</td>\n",

Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable.

The garlic prawns with tomato bread were the best! I also had some ham/cheese tapas, a beer and finished with some churos. It was 25 euros so well worth it. Would definitely go back! The inside is more bright and modern than I was expecting but it had a nice atmosphere and great food.  \n",

High quality small dishes, with a very wide offer. It is always full, you need to queue. Go with plenty of time. The atmosphere is great, service is fast and prices are reasonable. You can have a taste of the local cuisine with several small dishes. You will not go there only once.  \n",

Very good place with quality food and very good treatment by the waiters. For dessert I ordered the crema catalana and it is the best I've ever tasted, it was only 2.95 euros, amazing!  \n",

Food comes very quickly, best to not order too much at the same time. Staff is friendly, however can appear a bit rushed as this place seems to have a waiting line outside most of the time. But really a must-try!  \n",

Me and my friend ordered a lot of things and we pay a very reasonable price. The service is also very good. I recommend it 100%.  \n",

We went back again to this restaurant a few days later and also one of it's sister restaurant Vinitus. :)  \n",

       "13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I was recommended this place for Tapas during TripAdvisor search. They don't do reservations but there is a waiting list outside. First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.  \n",

I went at the end of November with a colleague and they expanded the restaurant but the quality is still the same: Excellent!  \n",

They were very disorganized and look lost and desperate while taking care the long waiting line.The food is good but you can find other places better than this one in barcelona. I hope they can improve their service because the place is very nice.  \n",

The is absolutely the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona. The food is fantastic, the drinks and wine very good, and the overall experience is definitely value-for-money. The staff is very friendly and service minded. Its not possible to book a table, so I recommend come early or be prepared to wait for a while to be seated. Great Experience!  \n",

After all the waiting the waiter started to tell us off. What? Definitely not recommended. The system of listing people outside is a mess. They don’t do reservations and everyone is packed in the front of the restaurant. And the employees tell you off. Poor service.  \n",

IT WAS THAT GOOD. The front-of-house was really friendly and accommodating. There was a long line-up or queue but it was worth it! Raquel was our server and she was the best! She recommended a lot of their popular tapas, and they did not disappoint at all! It was so so good! The seafood was fresh and properly cooked, we had grilled figs that was so fresh, and mushrooms with egg yolk. It was all divine. Everything was served nice and hot. The garlic shrimp, galician clams, grilled cuttlefish, and many more, are definitely what to order. The staff was absolutely friendly.  \n",

We had a big table, they made us leave because someone else was coming. But in the same time they did not let us book a table earlier.   \n",

The food was fantastic - great quality, freshly cooked and quickly served. We had been told about this place by friends who had been before and it didn’t disappoint!You can’t book but you turn up and leave your name and they tell you roughly how long until your table is ready, so you can nip off for a drink nearby then come back, which is what we did. Our table was called promptly when we came back so we didn’t have to wait. It is always very busy so make sure you are there when your name is called as I would imagine they don’t hold tables for long!The service was impeccable and very quick. The place is very buzzing and full of atmosphere, so it was great fun - but not the place for a quiet, leisurely meal.

Each time we think of the city, this restaurant comes to mind first. The food is excellent and the best service.The staff are very nice. Price is reasonable. Yes, the line is often long but it's worth the wait. If/when we go back to Barcelona and this restaurant is the first stop!!  \n",

We waited about 25 minutes for a table at around 8.30pm on a Sunday evening. The staff were friendly, the restaurant was spotlessly clean and the food was excellent. The two of us shared some red prawns, razor clams, some beef and some whitebait, followed by a kind of bread pudding and churros, plus a jug of sangria. Everything was excellent.   \n",

What a fantastic find. Hugely popular, with quite a queue, but very well worth the wait. The razor clams were fabulous, as was the anchovy montadito, the croquettes, the burnt Sant Teresa torrija and the house chardonnay. Very reasonably priced. Sherwin (waiter) was excellent.  \n",

I ate around 13:30, so it may have been slow and too early, but everything just seemed slow and mediocre in the restaurant.I ordered 4 different types of tapas, and only liked 1 of the items.It's a very tourist-recommended location, but I'd suggest trying other local restaurants.  \n",

The Maitre d Rachez wasan incredible host. She made you feel great even if their was a wait. The food was incredible. We had multiple Shrimp types, Potatas Bravas, beef tenderloin, mini burgers, calamari, fist, etc. The sangria was to die for. One thing to note was that there were 3 other girls who waited on us - Cherry, Elsie, and Vangie. When the were not running plates, they were busy getting the place in order (moving plates, cleaning up, etc.) Thank you Girls - You run that joint. Overall, we loved it here and would go back again and again.  \n",

It has a good location, a buzz about it, and clearly has excellent word of mouth. We came a few years ago, and have just returned this weekend. Over the years we have recommended it to many people.You go outside, put your name on the list, get told your waiting time, and come back after having had a drink elsewhere. Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!  \n",

I want to share my disappointment with this place. They have bad service and terrible food. We ordered several tapas, but the waitress decided he was not going to place all the order. When we asked why he didn't bring all the order out he said then that we don't live in SLAVE time anymore. I was so surprised with his answer, so I requested to please speak with the manager. We found out he waa the manager. He moved on with screaming, yelling and behaving as a terrible person and forgot his service job. We left that place and will NEVER return. Don't waste your time and money place, find instead the other better tapas places in Barcelona.  \n",

It was our first time trying tapas and we weren’t sure what to order so the waiter ordered for us. All of his suggestions were finger-licking good, the dessert too! Will definitely be coming back more often.  \n",

Some of the dishes change daily, but we thought they were all great (some pictures attached). Our particular favourite was the cabreaos eggs (spicy eggs), which is a bit of a play on eggs and chips ( and like 6 euro !)We tried most of the menu, and particularly loved all the seafood (and the tomato bread !) We will DEFINITELY be coming back here when we return to Barcelona!  \n",

Expunge for the quality we’ve received. Also we ordered a dish saying salat included and it arrived without it.

The place is generally crowded and there is a long waiting line (I went a week ago and tables were very spaced out, more relaxed and we were admitted quickly, these changes are due to covid) despite this, IT IS AMAZING and very, very, very worth it. The food is beyond incredible and dinning is an experience, fast paced and with many tapas ordered, it is fun, enjoyable and very exciting. I will never stop recommending it for locals or tourists. I have heard immaculate reviews from others. Definitely go if you have the oportunity :)  \n",

This is the first time that I'm really suspicious to a rating on TripAdvisor. How on earth can a restaurant like this have 4,5 with over 12 000 ratings. That is a mystery for me. The service was really a disgrace and the food was OK, nothing more. We were given a menu that was printed out on a paper and the printing black ink was faded on the menu so we couldn't read all of the menu and we couldn't see the prizes. When I told the waiter this he just showed me that all the menus were like that. Hahaha!And the dishes on the menu had no description so you had no idea what some of the stuff was or any sort of detail to it. There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it. We went away both hungry and just laughing at the entire experience. This was definitely our first and last time here.Spare your money and go to other restaurants that a actually great - there are plenty of them in Barcelona.   \n",

So Very Uncool. Especially that they didnt even try to find us other solution.Positiv: -8pm we could get a table without waiting-2 delicious tapas: sirloin and potatoes with eggs (all other tapas we took was maximum average quality)I was expected much better from this many positive feedbacks but I wouldnt come back here to eat. It would have been nicer in a smaller bar or restaurant where they care about the costumers.  \n",

Great service, fast. I recommend to visit and try catalan cream, tomato bread, all tapas.  \n",

We ended up here for breakfast every day! Great, simple breakfast menu with fantastically reasonable prices! We had lunch here one day too but for us breakfast stole the show! Always busy so be prepared to wait a bit but it was worth it for us!  \n",

But if you don't present full they won't let you sit on the table.Totally absence of Customer centricity.I have already arranged a business meeting in that place otherwise I would spare my money there   \n",

Always a pleasure! Great local food, always fresh, always tasty. Each time we've tried something else in the menu.This time we've set on the bar and had a great \"closer\" service experience as well.Until next time....  \n",
       "53   I have been going to this restaurant ever since I arrived in Barcelona 2 years ago and have recommended it to many of my colleagues and friends. However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET ROBBED WHILE ENJOYING YOUR MEAL AND THEN TREATED LIKE YOU ARE A THIEF AND TOLD YOU MUST NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU PAY THEN GO AHEAD AND EAT HERE.  \n",

I visited this place for the first time 8 years ago and now the plates are much smaller and the prices much higher, so I was a bit dissapointed during my second visit :/  \n",

When he stopped because he couldn’t walk more (just for a minute or some seconds) they couldn’t stop telling me rudely to move him out of the way because he was “bothering”. I understand they need to walk fast without obstacles and everything, but he was just laying down and annoying nobody. Unless they can cure him I can’t do anything else apart from waiting, but it’s not necessary to be so rude for just a sick dog that can’t move and needs to rest.Never gonna eat there ever again.  \n",

Exactly what I was expecting from a local tapas place. Ok you have to wait 20min to get a table but don't give up.Menu: there are so many tapas that you can go crazy and order more than you can handle! My recommendation: Bacalau, Boquerones en vinagre and andaluze, NavajasPrice: in couple we totally spent 62eur for 12 tapas, 2 glasses of wine and bottle of water.We were full and satisfied.  \n",

Although we have been there twice without reservations, it’s recommended to make reservations ... or be lucky like we were.They have an elaborate selection of small (tapas) and main dishes, really allowing to satisfy each taste and preference.Service is efficient, fast and quite friendly.The quality of the food, the size of the portions and the presentation are proof of the professionalism of this place.Prices are midrange and ok for what you get.Will go back.  \n",

I wanted to experience for myself what he saw and tasted. My family and I walked twice towards this restaurant for dinner! Both times we came out very satisfied and happy. Food is here is very good brought to our table by a very friendly staff. Love the service here and price is reasonable. Don't think twice. Come here. Order grilled red prawns and steak with foie gras, among many other good things-you will be happy, promise!  \n",

Everything was amazing...the food, the service, and the atmosphere! The classic Spanish tapas like patatas bravas, pan con tomates, jamon iberico, and Spanish cheeses were wonderful as well as typical Catalan dishes like artichokes with shrimp and clams, fresh fried calamari, and crema catalana. Homemade sangria was perfect. Selection of wines by the glass was great. We will definitely be back here on our next trip. Best meal of the week in Barcelona!  \n",

It did not disappoint. Great energy, vibe and food was delicious. Try the skinny fries covered in an aioli with an egg on top. Sounds simple but was very tasty.   \n",

Arrived at about 8pm and were told there was a 30 minute wait for a table. After a drink at the bar we were called to our table after about 20 minutes. It was well worth the wait! Great food, great service and all reasonably priced. Very busy, great vibe/atmosphere, would go back again tomorrow if we could!!!!  \n",

Twice the wait was about an hour long and once 30 minutes. We saw large number of people waiting on all occasions.Having said all that, the food is quite good. We tried a variety of tapas on each occasions and most were quite tasty. Price was fairly reasonable to us too. milespointstravel.com  \n",

There was a short wait, but we were able to get seats the counter after just a few minutes. The service was prompt and professional. We enjoyed a liter of sangria with a steady flow of tapas. We tried many things, but especially enjoyed the garlic shrimp and the bombas - you definitely need to try the bombas! Would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona!  \n",

The food was ok, but not tasty. I don’t recommend.  \n",

The Tapas are very nice . Everything is very tasty and there is a big variety of fish food .The wine was also very nice and the desert . You can also sit at the bar to drink your wine or beer and eat a tapas. You need to reserve a table otherwise in rash hour you must wait more than an hour .   \n",

But it really worth it. The food is at very reasonable price and very tasty.  \n",

What an amazing meal. Came here on recommendation and did not disappoint. Busy packed place. Expect to wait for few minutes. Maybe if you sit at bar. Sat at bar and had front view of dishes tapas. Had 8 tapas. Steak to prawns to shrimp peppers to codfish the best. To more double takings. Amazing taste and affordable price. 9 tapas for 30 euros plus a beer. Not bad. Come here for a local busy pack place to eat and enjoy the crowd.   \n",

The tapas as amazing! Their options are reasonably priced for their serving, and everything was delicious. The server recommended Solomillo de ternera con foie (Beef tenderloin with foie gras) and it was an absolutely precious. The staff is super helpful and efficient, excellent service. I’d go back here. I will fly back to Barcelona to eat here. Expect a queue for dinner, but who can blame them? This is a great place!  \n",

The best we ever had in Spain. We ate there 7 times.Tried all seafood and mushrooms, even the potato and grilled peppers. All good.Wish they had a menu like in the Japanese restaurants with photos. I only know a limited Spanish. of course you can google the dishes and check what others order.  \n",

The prices are a bit expensive (2-4 euro for one open sandwich), but the food is seriously high quality. Definitely make a reservation as we came and it was packed out the front door. We were seated outside but still received pretty good and fast service, enough for my girlfriend and I to have enough time to hang out and chat over the food.  \n",

We made a reservation for 12 people, but at first we were in 11, waiting for one more to arrive. In the begining the waiters were already rude, but as we were there for a nice time with Friends, we didnt want to make a big thing from that. But the episodes started to occur, for instance, when one of the waiters complained because we were not ordering all the things for once (we were in a group of 11 and we were eating tapas, so no way everybody would order at the same time). When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling. At this time we couldnt stand the situation anymore and stood up to leave. The manager probably realized he and his team f***ed up and told us to stay because he was putting another chair for our friend. Too little too late. WORST EXPERIENCE IN A RESTAURANT IN MY WHOLE LIFE.  \n",

From the begging the waiters were very rude, throwing our orders at the table and putting very strange pressure for us to order fast and in the order they wanted. We had a table for 12 people but were 11. When our 12th friend arrived, they started saying it was not possible for him to sit and started counting the number of us, as if we would be cheating wrt the number of people!! We were consuming a lot and yet receiving awful service!Pathetic.  \n",

And by the time the 12th person arrive the staff did not get a chair for her. Believe or not the manager started to count the number of people.Terrible felling as tourist....  \n",

We went there for lunch and enjoyed everything we've ordered. A large selection of Tapas could be found here. we've tried Patatas Bravas, Foie Gras with tenderloin, Shrimp Skewers and many more.  The food was fantastic. We couldn't help but to come here again for dinner during our short stay in Barcelona. It is definitely our first choice when it comes to Tapas.  \n",

If you prefer o sit at the table, you have to wait. You can be lucky and get the place at bar, which is not a bad alternative at all.Food is amazingly taste. Really difficult to choose the best one. After eating of the first pieces, you will think to order all menu. Just go there and enjoy...  \n",

This place is very popular and very busy but is it the authentic Spanish tapas experience? I think not. Perhaps go here if you have a large group or you are on a bus tour. The atmosphere is loud, brightly lit and like that of a cafeteria (maybe a wee bit nicer). The quality of the food is fair but the staff are determined to get people in and out as quickly as they can. Prices are high. Credit to the staff who are working very hard.  \n",

I think the only difference is a slightly smaller wait time (5-10 minutes) and the name on the building. I love the tapas here. Try it all, you cannot go wrong. The albariño wines are my favorite and pair well with almost everything on the menu.  \n",

The waiter who served us was helpful, though his colleague spoke little English, and was extremely brisk.There was a large number of asian tourists here; not a bad thing, but indicative of the market it caters for and the price hike as a result.The food was uniformly excellent. The fried green peppers were an unexpected delight. If money is no object, then go crazy and I'm sure you'll have a ball.  \n",

Be there early to get a sit straight away and a good time to eat the menu ! Staff are all professional meaning they rush at 100 miles an hour to serve everyone . The food is fabulous. Have not had one bad dish .  \n",

Only down side is how crowded it gets at 20h onwards and the long waiting cue at dinner time.  \n",

The selection of tapas we ordered were all great and the portion was quite big. Service is great and most staff can speak English...  \n",

And I remember having to stand (for an hour) behind someone at the counter just to secure a narrow spot for myself.But the Philippino who served me was super nice (as our countries are neighbours ).Overall it was such a lovely time and of course the yummylicious food. I went back there again the next day with a friend and yep, we still had to wait for an hour but it was a pleasant experience ❤️  \n",

English speaking. No vegan options but for those without dietary concerns or budget issues this is a great place  \n",

Not anything amazing but make sure to try calcots (grilled leeks served with romesco sauce) if there in Winter. Staff were a little bit pushy in trying to get us to have dessert.   \n",

I'm sure others would love the place and the ambiance - but it certainly wasn't to our taste...  \n",

The Codfish Fritters (daily special) were outstanding - best I’ve ever had. Very busy place, so go early.  \n",

Special thanks to Ruel! Such a friendly and positive waiter. Ask his recommendations, every dish he suggested was absolutely fabulous. My top three:- cod with honey and tomatoes;- beef with foie gras;- camembert with almonds and berries.  \n",

It was pretty packed outside and inside. Being there for the first time, we did not know where or how we could get into the queue for a table. Therefore went inside and was told off by the queue lady because we were standing on the wrong side of where we were supposed to be. Brushed that off as them being flustered due to the high number of customers but a bit of signage to let customers know where to queue would be helpful (and perhaps a little more service training for the queue lady would be awesome)Got in the queue, was told 30-45 mins. As there were a few customers in front that left, we promptly got a table. The waitress we had was patient and helpful with our orders. Food came out pretty quickly although there were some pretty hefty gaps between some orders (10-15 mins??)We tried re-ordering from a tall man with glasses but was told to “wait” and he never came back. He was constantly shaking his head at other customers after taking their orders so we took our next order with another server. Service was pretty patchy depending on which moody (or happy) person you got. Food highlights (we ordered 8 tapas for 2 people for €66.30 euro)- Cod with honey “allioli”- Beef tenderloin with foie gras- Crispy camembert- Shrimp “al ajillo”  \n",

There was such a variety of great, authentic Spanish food and we enjoyed absolutely all of it! We came back two days in a row and would be glad to return again and again! Can’t wait for friends and family to visit Spain so we can show them some EXCELLENT food :P  \n",

Best tapas- the filet with froe gras is the best I’ve ever had, grilled shrimp are delicious, and potatoes with aoli are heavenly. Reasonable prices on outstanding food, and good wine. Despite no reservations and long lines with typical waits of an hour at mealtime, it was totally worth the wait.  \n",

Grilled clams and prawns are quite good. My favorite tapas here is grilled tenderloin with foie, which is very tasty.The service is so so because this is a very busy place. The waiter forgot one of my orders.  \n",

Dinner services was average cause once we sit down we order a bottle of champagne. Lunch was in very poor services. Coffee waited for 20mins. Requested to order thought 4 staff still no one come. We tried to order signature grill octopus but the manager said only a word “no” till we saw other tables have it then another staff helped to order. What a service! Don’t understand why they need to provide such service as we are very polite. The key point is all food weren’t hot just a bit warm or even in room temperature.  \n",

We went to quite a few tapas bars- each unique. But nothing compares to the variety, service, taste and ease of ordering for non- Spanish speakers. The restaurant was recommended (again) by locals who enjoy it tooThe fillet looked amazing but we weren’t in mood for meat.  \n",

However, the tapas were very ordinary but the desserts stood out. In fact, the desserts were very impressive. I would say, just go for the foie gras with tenderloin tapas and the desserts (coconut pudding and the bread pudding!!)  \n",

They make you feel at ease when you’re eating there and the Filipino servers do know how to suggest what tapas to have and drinks to take. The server Ruel at the bar really knows what’s the fresh catch of the day are so when you’re there for the first time try to seat at the bar. Definitely, it’s worth the experience.  \n",

Great atmosphere and great service. Made our first night in Barcelona special. Yes a little on the expensive side but well worth it. Highly recommend   \n",

We ordered quite a lot of different tapas and we weren’t disappointed with any of them. All delicious and tasty. I’m always surprised at how reasonable the costs are in restaurants in Barcelona. I find them much cheaper than UK restaurants. It was roughly €120 for 5 people - we must have had 10 tapas and a paella for 2 to share with a small jug of sangria, 2 beers and several cokes. Staff were attentive, friendly and accommodating. All round great experience.  \n",

Maybe better less crowded options at same price point - not worth more than a ten minute wait - it’s just not  \n",

I am glad to say it did not disappoint! Arriving with our tired 5 year old we were treated incredibly well and the lady at the front along with Ruel made a special effort to seat us quickly. Fortunately we got sat at the bar and Ruel made us feel very special right away, giving us tips on what we should try and being so attentive, it was like he could read our minds! All of the dishes we tried were incredible and we came away eating and drinking way more than we had originally planned. The ambience, level of service and quality of food made this one of our most memorable dining experiences ever - it was so good that we came back the next night and none of the magic was lost. It also said a lot that there were faces that we had seen the previous night who were there again also.To the owners - you are lucky to have such wonderful people working at your restaurant. Along with the incredible food that you serve, they make the whole experience first class. Ruel in particular is a huge asset and we loved the way he took care of us on both nights that we visited. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Barcelona!  \n",

We had great seafood for our first visit: clams, scallops, fried small fish. When we came the second time, most seafood was run-out of stock: mussels, seafood plate ... We ended up having Spanish omelette and cod in honey sauce, which was not as tasty.  \n",

Since we've planned on a big dinner, we only wanted to order a Tapa or two. Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese & Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.  \n",

How? One waitress can change everything. He was not in the mood and affected our decisions. somehow we ordered something very weird. because of the language problems we didnt understand if we ordered something wrong or he didnt understand.   \n",

I appreciate this and had a great experience. Food was amazing and would go back anytime I can.  \n",

We ordered a couple of dishes, and expected a lot due to the reviews and recommendations from friends. All was amazing besides the razor clams, I expected a little more from the razor clams. People were nice, and our waiter was very knowledgeable. We will return again to give this another try.  \n",

Stumbled upon this restaurant that had people spilling out the door. Good that I was solo because the helpful hostess and servers at the bar got me seated immediately and I was so glad because I was able to meet Ruel, William, Jordi and a younger, cute fellow who had nickname but I can’t recall if they told me his real name. Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable. Overall the food was great, the Sangria top notch but it was the service that really sold me on the tapas place. I really hope I have some time to stop by again before my trip ends but I will be sure to come back the next time in Barcelona!  \n",

It's gotten a little touristy, but with patience you can find a table or a spot at the bar. You won't be disappointed by the quality, the variety and the prices of the tapas (i recommend shrimps). Also the sandwiches are really good.  \n",

HOWEVER, this is a tourist trap, with the worst service ever. First of all, the server acted like he didn't even want to be here. Second of all, he had ZERO knowledge about hygiene and food safety. When he brought out the first tapa ( mushrooms w egg yolk ), his thumb was touching the rim of the plate and nail was touching the mushroom. By the third tapa, he looked at me as his thumb touched the tomato bread. And he handed me a new plate with grease on it. Thinking about all the germs he had in his nails... YUCK.  \n",

The choice is enormous, every bite is heaven. And many people know this, and that is why this place during dinner times is absolutely loaded. The first time I had to come back for a table at 23:30 (thank god Barcelona had crazy dinner times). Normally between 16-17 in the afternoon you can find a place at the bar. Anyway, when in Barcelona, don't miss this place.  \n",

Some dishes better than others. Very friendly service. Worth booking places in advance as there is a long line. We sat outside but it seems that the better atmosphere is inside... we could not wait for our turn :(...  \n",

So after a long trip and an afternoon nap, this place was a great to taste several tapas, beer and wine. The razor clams are great among the other 10 tapas we tried. The nata dessert was also excellent and the service was great.   \n",

Too bad we only went there on our last night in town. Good food, great service staff. They were lively and made good recommendation for us to try. Service was quick too and we didnt have to wait long for food. However, this place is popular so go early if you want a good table. we sat outside in the cold, which was fine. Overall love this place. will be back  \n",

Thursday evening around six we were able to get a table immediately. Our server, Raquel, was very helpful explaining the differences between the tapas and mondtiditos. We ordered several items including sardines, crispy eggplant, mushrooms with asparagus codfish fritters and enjoyed everything. Two nites later we returned and Raquel remembered us. This time we tried garlic shrimp and a fried platter of squid, sardines and cuttlefish with mini poblanos plus a couple of “old favorites and a pitcher of sangria. Second dinner was even better and we then took Raquel’s dessert recommendation of bread pudding which is more of a soufflé with a creamy interior—scrumptious! Prices are very reasonable, service is quick and they are open from 9:30am to 1:30 am. If we return to Barcelona, we will return to Catalana  \n",

You can’t make a reservation, but if you eat around 6:30-7:00 you shouldn’t have much of a wait. When we left at 9:30, the line was out the door. They have a regular menu and a specials menu. A couple of dishes we wanted from the specials menu were already sold out. We loved the razor clams, the burrata salad and the ham and cheese mini sandwich the best, but everything we tried was good. Make sure to save room for the burnt St Joan bread pudding. Service was friendly and very efficient. We would definitely return.  \n",

First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.</td>\n",

Over the years we have recommended it to many people.You go outside, put your name on the list, get told your waiting time, and come back after having had a drink elsewhere. Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!</td>\n",

How on earth can a restaurant like this have 4,5 with over 12 000 ratings. That is a mystery for me. The service was really a disgrace and the food was OK, nothing more. We were given a menu that was printed out on a paper and the printing black ink was faded on the menu so we couldn't read all of the menu and we couldn't see the prizes. When I told the waiter this he just showed me that all the menus were like that. Hahaha!And the dishes on the menu had no description so you had no idea what some of the stuff was or any sort of detail to it. There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it. We went away both hungry and just laughing at the entire experience.

However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated.

But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling.

I find them much cheaper than UK restaurants. It was roughly €120 for 5 people - we must have had 10 tapas and a paella for 2 to share with a small jug of sangria, 2 beers and several cokes. Staff were attentive, friendly and accommodating. All round great experience.</td>\n",

Arriving with our tired 5 year old we were treated incredibly well and the lady at the front along with Ruel made a special effort to seat us quickly. Fortunately we got sat at the bar and Ruel made us feel very special right away, giving us tips on what we should try and being so attentive, it was like he could read our minds! All of the dishes we tried were incredible and we came away eating and drinking way more than we had originally planned. The ambience, level of service and quality of food made this one of our most memorable dining experiences ever - it was so good that we came back the next night and none of the magic was lost. It also said a lot that there were faces that we had seen the previous night who were there again also.To the owners - you are lucky to have such wonderful people working at your restaurant. Along with the incredible food that you serve, they make the whole experience first class. Ruel in particular is a huge asset and we loved the way he took care of us on both nights that we visited. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Barcelona!</td>\n",

Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese &amp; Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.</td>\n",

Good that I was solo because the helpful hostess and servers at the bar got me seated immediately and I was so glad because I was able to meet Ruel, William, Jordi and a younger, cute fellow who had nickname but I can’t recall if they told me his real name. Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable. Overall the food was great, the Sangria top notch but it was the service that really sold me on the tapas place.

The garlic prawns with tomato bread were the best! I also had some ham/cheese tapas, a beer and finished with some churos. It was 25 euros so well worth it. Would definitely go back! The inside is more bright and modern than I was expecting but it had a nice atmosphere and great food.  \n",

High quality small dishes, with a very wide offer. It is always full, you need to queue. Go with plenty of time. The atmosphere is great, service is fast and prices are reasonable. You can have a taste of the local cuisine with several small dishes. You will not go there only once.  \n",

Very good place with quality food and very good treatment by the waiters. For dessert I ordered the crema catalana and it is the best I've ever tasted, it was only 2.95 euros, amazing!  \n",

Food comes very quickly, best to not order too much at the same time. Staff is friendly, however can appear a bit rushed as this place seems to have a waiting line outside most of the time. But really a must-try!  \n",

Me and my friend ordered a lot of things and we pay a very reasonable price. The service is also very good. I recommend it 100%.  \n",

We went back again to this restaurant a few days later and also one of it's sister restaurant Vinitus. :)  \n",

       "13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I was recommended this place for Tapas during TripAdvisor search. They don't do reservations but there is a waiting list outside. First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.  \n",

I went at the end of November with a colleague and they expanded the restaurant but the quality is still the same: Excellent!  \n",

They were very disorganized and look lost and desperate while taking care the long waiting line.The food is good but you can find other places better than this one in barcelona. I hope they can improve their service because the place is very nice.  \n",

The is absolutely the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona. The food is fantastic, the drinks and wine very good, and the overall experience is definitely value-for-money. The staff is very friendly and service minded. Its not possible to book a table, so I recommend come early or be prepared to wait for a while to be seated. Great Experience!  \n",

After all the waiting the waiter started to tell us off. What? Definitely not recommended. The system of listing people outside is a mess. They don’t do reservations and everyone is packed in the front of the restaurant. And the employees tell you off. Poor service.  \n",

IT WAS THAT GOOD. The front-of-house was really friendly and accommodating. There was a long line-up or queue but it was worth it! Raquel was our server and she was the best! She recommended a lot of their popular tapas, and they did not disappoint at all! It was so so good! The seafood was fresh and properly cooked, we had grilled figs that was so fresh, and mushrooms with egg yolk. It was all divine. Everything was served nice and hot. The garlic shrimp, galician clams, grilled cuttlefish, and many more, are definitely what to order. The staff was absolutely friendly.  \n",

We had a big table, they made us leave because someone else was coming. But in the same time they did not let us book a table earlier.   \n",

The food was fantastic - great quality, freshly cooked and quickly served. We had been told about this place by friends who had been before and it didn’t disappoint!You can’t book but you turn up and leave your name and they tell you roughly how long until your table is ready, so you can nip off for a drink nearby then come back, which is what we did. Our table was called promptly when we came back so we didn’t have to wait. It is always very busy so make sure you are there when your name is called as I would imagine they don’t hold tables for long!The service was impeccable and very quick. The place is very buzzing and full of atmosphere, so it was great fun - but not the place for a quiet, leisurely meal.

Each time we think of the city, this restaurant comes to mind first. The food is excellent and the best service.The staff are very nice. Price is reasonable. Yes, the line is often long but it's worth the wait. If/when we go back to Barcelona and this restaurant is the first stop!!  \n",

We waited about 25 minutes for a table at around 8.30pm on a Sunday evening. The staff were friendly, the restaurant was spotlessly clean and the food was excellent. The two of us shared some red prawns, razor clams, some beef and some whitebait, followed by a kind of bread pudding and churros, plus a jug of sangria. Everything was excellent.   \n",

What a fantastic find. Hugely popular, with quite a queue, but very well worth the wait. The razor clams were fabulous, as was the anchovy montadito, the croquettes, the burnt Sant Teresa torrija and the house chardonnay. Very reasonably priced. Sherwin (waiter) was excellent.  \n",

I ate around 13:30, so it may have been slow and too early, but everything just seemed slow and mediocre in the restaurant.I ordered 4 different types of tapas, and only liked 1 of the items.It's a very tourist-recommended location, but I'd suggest trying other local restaurants.  \n",

The Maitre d Rachez wasan incredible host. She made you feel great even if their was a wait. The food was incredible. We had multiple Shrimp types, Potatas Bravas, beef tenderloin, mini burgers, calamari, fist, etc. The sangria was to die for. One thing to note was that there were 3 other girls who waited on us - Cherry, Elsie, and Vangie. When the were not running plates, they were busy getting the place in order (moving plates, cleaning up, etc.) Thank you Girls - You run that joint. Overall, we loved it here and would go back again and again.  \n",

It has a good location, a buzz about it, and clearly has excellent word of mouth. We came a few years ago, and have just returned this weekend. Over the years we have recommended it to many people.You go outside, put your name on the list, get told your waiting time, and come back after having had a drink elsewhere. Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!  \n",

I want to share my disappointment with this place. They have bad service and terrible food. We ordered several tapas, but the waitress decided he was not going to place all the order. When we asked why he didn't bring all the order out he said then that we don't live in SLAVE time anymore. I was so surprised with his answer, so I requested to please speak with the manager. We found out he waa the manager. He moved on with screaming, yelling and behaving as a terrible person and forgot his service job. We left that place and will NEVER return. Don't waste your time and money place, find instead the other better tapas places in Barcelona.  \n",

It was our first time trying tapas and we weren’t sure what to order so the waiter ordered for us. All of his suggestions were finger-licking good, the dessert too! Will definitely be coming back more often.  \n",

Some of the dishes change daily, but we thought they were all great (some pictures attached). Our particular favourite was the cabreaos eggs (spicy eggs), which is a bit of a play on eggs and chips ( and like 6 euro !)We tried most of the menu, and particularly loved all the seafood (and the tomato bread !) We will DEFINITELY be coming back here when we return to Barcelona!  \n",

Expunge for the quality we’ve received. Also we ordered a dish saying salat included and it arrived without it.

The place is generally crowded and there is a long waiting line (I went a week ago and tables were very spaced out, more relaxed and we were admitted quickly, these changes are due to covid) despite this, IT IS AMAZING and very, very, very worth it. The food is beyond incredible and dinning is an experience, fast paced and with many tapas ordered, it is fun, enjoyable and very exciting. I will never stop recommending it for locals or tourists. I have heard immaculate reviews from others. Definitely go if you have the oportunity :)  \n",

This is the first time that I'm really suspicious to a rating on TripAdvisor. How on earth can a restaurant like this have 4,5 with over 12 000 ratings. That is a mystery for me. The service was really a disgrace and the food was OK, nothing more. We were given a menu that was printed out on a paper and the printing black ink was faded on the menu so we couldn't read all of the menu and we couldn't see the prizes. When I told the waiter this he just showed me that all the menus were like that. Hahaha!And the dishes on the menu had no description so you had no idea what some of the stuff was or any sort of detail to it. There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it. We went away both hungry and just laughing at the entire experience. This was definitely our first and last time here.Spare your money and go to other restaurants that a actually great - there are plenty of them in Barcelona.   \n",

So Very Uncool. Especially that they didnt even try to find us other solution.Positiv: -8pm we could get a table without waiting-2 delicious tapas: sirloin and potatoes with eggs (all other tapas we took was maximum average quality)I was expected much better from this many positive feedbacks but I wouldnt come back here to eat. It would have been nicer in a smaller bar or restaurant where they care about the costumers.  \n",

Great service, fast. I recommend to visit and try catalan cream, tomato bread, all tapas.  \n",

We ended up here for breakfast every day! Great, simple breakfast menu with fantastically reasonable prices! We had lunch here one day too but for us breakfast stole the show! Always busy so be prepared to wait a bit but it was worth it for us!  \n",

But if you don't present full they won't let you sit on the table.Totally absence of Customer centricity.I have already arranged a business meeting in that place otherwise I would spare my money there   \n",

Always a pleasure! Great local food, always fresh, always tasty. Each time we've tried something else in the menu.This time we've set on the bar and had a great \"closer\" service experience as well.Until next time....  \n",
       "53   I have been going to this restaurant ever since I arrived in Barcelona 2 years ago and have recommended it to many of my colleagues and friends. However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET ROBBED WHILE ENJOYING YOUR MEAL AND THEN TREATED LIKE YOU ARE A THIEF AND TOLD YOU MUST NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU PAY THEN GO AHEAD AND EAT HERE.  \n",

I visited this place for the first time 8 years ago and now the plates are much smaller and the prices much higher, so I was a bit dissapointed during my second visit :/  \n",

When he stopped because he couldn’t walk more (just for a minute or some seconds) they couldn’t stop telling me rudely to move him out of the way because he was “bothering”. I understand they need to walk fast without obstacles and everything, but he was just laying down and annoying nobody. Unless they can cure him I can’t do anything else apart from waiting, but it’s not necessary to be so rude for just a sick dog that can’t move and needs to rest.Never gonna eat there ever again.  \n",

Exactly what I was expecting from a local tapas place. Ok you have to wait 20min to get a table but don't give up.Menu: there are so many tapas that you can go crazy and order more than you can handle! My recommendation: Bacalau, Boquerones en vinagre and andaluze, NavajasPrice: in couple we totally spent 62eur for 12 tapas, 2 glasses of wine and bottle of water.We were full and satisfied.  \n",

Although we have been there twice without reservations, it’s recommended to make reservations ... or be lucky like we were.They have an elaborate selection of small (tapas) and main dishes, really allowing to satisfy each taste and preference.Service is efficient, fast and quite friendly.The quality of the food, the size of the portions and the presentation are proof of the professionalism of this place.Prices are midrange and ok for what you get.Will go back.  \n",

I wanted to experience for myself what he saw and tasted. My family and I walked twice towards this restaurant for dinner! Both times we came out very satisfied and happy. Food is here is very good brought to our table by a very friendly staff. Love the service here and price is reasonable. Don't think twice. Come here. Order grilled red prawns and steak with foie gras, among many other good things-you will be happy, promise!  \n",

Everything was amazing...the food, the service, and the atmosphere! The classic Spanish tapas like patatas bravas, pan con tomates, jamon iberico, and Spanish cheeses were wonderful as well as typical Catalan dishes like artichokes with shrimp and clams, fresh fried calamari, and crema catalana. Homemade sangria was perfect. Selection of wines by the glass was great. We will definitely be back here on our next trip. Best meal of the week in Barcelona!  \n",

It did not disappoint. Great energy, vibe and food was delicious. Try the skinny fries covered in an aioli with an egg on top. Sounds simple but was very tasty.   \n",

Arrived at about 8pm and were told there was a 30 minute wait for a table. After a drink at the bar we were called to our table after about 20 minutes. It was well worth the wait! Great food, great service and all reasonably priced. Very busy, great vibe/atmosphere, would go back again tomorrow if we could!!!!  \n",

Twice the wait was about an hour long and once 30 minutes. We saw large number of people waiting on all occasions.Having said all that, the food is quite good. We tried a variety of tapas on each occasions and most were quite tasty. Price was fairly reasonable to us too. milespointstravel.com  \n",

There was a short wait, but we were able to get seats the counter after just a few minutes. The service was prompt and professional. We enjoyed a liter of sangria with a steady flow of tapas. We tried many things, but especially enjoyed the garlic shrimp and the bombas - you definitely need to try the bombas! Would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona!  \n",

The food was ok, but not tasty. I don’t recommend.  \n",

The Tapas are very nice . Everything is very tasty and there is a big variety of fish food .The wine was also very nice and the desert . You can also sit at the bar to drink your wine or beer and eat a tapas. You need to reserve a table otherwise in rash hour you must wait more than an hour .   \n",

But it really worth it. The food is at very reasonable price and very tasty.  \n",

What an amazing meal. Came here on recommendation and did not disappoint. Busy packed place. Expect to wait for few minutes. Maybe if you sit at bar. Sat at bar and had front view of dishes tapas. Had 8 tapas. Steak to prawns to shrimp peppers to codfish the best. To more double takings. Amazing taste and affordable price. 9 tapas for 30 euros plus a beer. Not bad. Come here for a local busy pack place to eat and enjoy the crowd.   \n",

The tapas as amazing! Their options are reasonably priced for their serving, and everything was delicious. The server recommended Solomillo de ternera con foie (Beef tenderloin with foie gras) and it was an absolutely precious. The staff is super helpful and efficient, excellent service. I’d go back here. I will fly back to Barcelona to eat here. Expect a queue for dinner, but who can blame them? This is a great place!  \n",

The best we ever had in Spain. We ate there 7 times.Tried all seafood and mushrooms, even the potato and grilled peppers. All good.Wish they had a menu like in the Japanese restaurants with photos. I only know a limited Spanish. of course you can google the dishes and check what others order.  \n",

The prices are a bit expensive (2-4 euro for one open sandwich), but the food is seriously high quality. Definitely make a reservation as we came and it was packed out the front door. We were seated outside but still received pretty good and fast service, enough for my girlfriend and I to have enough time to hang out and chat over the food.  \n",

We made a reservation for 12 people, but at first we were in 11, waiting for one more to arrive. In the begining the waiters were already rude, but as we were there for a nice time with Friends, we didnt want to make a big thing from that. But the episodes started to occur, for instance, when one of the waiters complained because we were not ordering all the things for once (we were in a group of 11 and we were eating tapas, so no way everybody would order at the same time). When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling. At this time we couldnt stand the situation anymore and stood up to leave. The manager probably realized he and his team f***ed up and told us to stay because he was putting another chair for our friend. Too little too late. WORST EXPERIENCE IN A RESTAURANT IN MY WHOLE LIFE.  \n",

From the begging the waiters were very rude, throwing our orders at the table and putting very strange pressure for us to order fast and in the order they wanted. We had a table for 12 people but were 11. When our 12th friend arrived, they started saying it was not possible for him to sit and started counting the number of us, as if we would be cheating wrt the number of people!! We were consuming a lot and yet receiving awful service!Pathetic.  \n",

And by the time the 12th person arrive the staff did not get a chair for her. Believe or not the manager started to count the number of people.Terrible felling as tourist....  \n",

We went there for lunch and enjoyed everything we've ordered. A large selection of Tapas could be found here. we've tried Patatas Bravas, Foie Gras with tenderloin, Shrimp Skewers and many more.  The food was fantastic. We couldn't help but to come here again for dinner during our short stay in Barcelona. It is definitely our first choice when it comes to Tapas.  \n",

If you prefer o sit at the table, you have to wait. You can be lucky and get the place at bar, which is not a bad alternative at all.Food is amazingly taste. Really difficult to choose the best one. After eating of the first pieces, you will think to order all menu. Just go there and enjoy...  \n",

This place is very popular and very busy but is it the authentic Spanish tapas experience? I think not. Perhaps go here if you have a large group or you are on a bus tour. The atmosphere is loud, brightly lit and like that of a cafeteria (maybe a wee bit nicer). The quality of the food is fair but the staff are determined to get people in and out as quickly as they can. Prices are high. Credit to the staff who are working very hard.  \n",

I think the only difference is a slightly smaller wait time (5-10 minutes) and the name on the building. I love the tapas here. Try it all, you cannot go wrong. The albariño wines are my favorite and pair well with almost everything on the menu.  \n",

The waiter who served us was helpful, though his colleague spoke little English, and was extremely brisk.There was a large number of asian tourists here; not a bad thing, but indicative of the market it caters for and the price hike as a result.The food was uniformly excellent. The fried green peppers were an unexpected delight. If money is no object, then go crazy and I'm sure you'll have a ball.  \n",

Be there early to get a sit straight away and a good time to eat the menu ! Staff are all professional meaning they rush at 100 miles an hour to serve everyone . The food is fabulous. Have not had one bad dish .  \n",

Only down side is how crowded it gets at 20h onwards and the long waiting cue at dinner time.  \n",

The selection of tapas we ordered were all great and the portion was quite big. Service is great and most staff can speak English...  \n",

And I remember having to stand (for an hour) behind someone at the counter just to secure a narrow spot for myself.But the Philippino who served me was super nice (as our countries are neighbours ).Overall it was such a lovely time and of course the yummylicious food. I went back there again the next day with a friend and yep, we still had to wait for an hour but it was a pleasant experience ❤️  \n",

English speaking. No vegan options but for those without dietary concerns or budget issues this is a great place  \n",

Not anything amazing but make sure to try calcots (grilled leeks served with romesco sauce) if there in Winter. Staff were a little bit pushy in trying to get us to have dessert.   \n",

I'm sure others would love the place and the ambiance - but it certainly wasn't to our taste...  \n",

The Codfish Fritters (daily special) were outstanding - best I’ve ever had. Very busy place, so go early.  \n",

Special thanks to Ruel! Such a friendly and positive waiter. Ask his recommendations, every dish he suggested was absolutely fabulous. My top three:- cod with honey and tomatoes;- beef with foie gras;- camembert with almonds and berries.  \n",

It was pretty packed outside and inside. Being there for the first time, we did not know where or how we could get into the queue for a table. Therefore went inside and was told off by the queue lady because we were standing on the wrong side of where we were supposed to be. Brushed that off as them being flustered due to the high number of customers but a bit of signage to let customers know where to queue would be helpful (and perhaps a little more service training for the queue lady would be awesome)Got in the queue, was told 30-45 mins. As there were a few customers in front that left, we promptly got a table. The waitress we had was patient and helpful with our orders. Food came out pretty quickly although there were some pretty hefty gaps between some orders (10-15 mins??)We tried re-ordering from a tall man with glasses but was told to “wait” and he never came back. He was constantly shaking his head at other customers after taking their orders so we took our next order with another server. Service was pretty patchy depending on which moody (or happy) person you got. Food highlights (we ordered 8 tapas for 2 people for €66.30 euro)- Cod with honey “allioli”- Beef tenderloin with foie gras- Crispy camembert- Shrimp “al ajillo”  \n",

There was such a variety of great, authentic Spanish food and we enjoyed absolutely all of it! We came back two days in a row and would be glad to return again and again! Can’t wait for friends and family to visit Spain so we can show them some EXCELLENT food :P  \n",

Best tapas- the filet with froe gras is the best I’ve ever had, grilled shrimp are delicious, and potatoes with aoli are heavenly. Reasonable prices on outstanding food, and good wine. Despite no reservations and long lines with typical waits of an hour at mealtime, it was totally worth the wait.  \n",

Grilled clams and prawns are quite good. My favorite tapas here is grilled tenderloin with foie, which is very tasty.The service is so so because this is a very busy place. The waiter forgot one of my orders.  \n",

Dinner services was average cause once we sit down we order a bottle of champagne. Lunch was in very poor services. Coffee waited for 20mins. Requested to order thought 4 staff still no one come. We tried to order signature grill octopus but the manager said only a word “no” till we saw other tables have it then another staff helped to order. What a service! Don’t understand why they need to provide such service as we are very polite. The key point is all food weren’t hot just a bit warm or even in room temperature.  \n",

We went to quite a few tapas bars- each unique. But nothing compares to the variety, service, taste and ease of ordering for non- Spanish speakers. The restaurant was recommended (again) by locals who enjoy it tooThe fillet looked amazing but we weren’t in mood for meat.  \n",

However, the tapas were very ordinary but the desserts stood out. In fact, the desserts were very impressive. I would say, just go for the foie gras with tenderloin tapas and the desserts (coconut pudding and the bread pudding!!)  \n",

They make you feel at ease when you’re eating there and the Filipino servers do know how to suggest what tapas to have and drinks to take. The server Ruel at the bar really knows what’s the fresh catch of the day are so when you’re there for the first time try to seat at the bar. Definitely, it’s worth the experience.  \n",

Great atmosphere and great service. Made our first night in Barcelona special. Yes a little on the expensive side but well worth it. Highly recommend   \n",

We ordered quite a lot of different tapas and we weren’t disappointed with any of them. All delicious and tasty. I’m always surprised at how reasonable the costs are in restaurants in Barcelona. I find them much cheaper than UK restaurants. It was roughly €120 for 5 people - we must have had 10 tapas and a paella for 2 to share with a small jug of sangria, 2 beers and several cokes. Staff were attentive, friendly and accommodating. All round great experience.  \n",

Maybe better less crowded options at same price point - not worth more than a ten minute wait - it’s just not  \n",

I am glad to say it did not disappoint! Arriving with our tired 5 year old we were treated incredibly well and the lady at the front along with Ruel made a special effort to seat us quickly. Fortunately we got sat at the bar and Ruel made us feel very special right away, giving us tips on what we should try and being so attentive, it was like he could read our minds! All of the dishes we tried were incredible and we came away eating and drinking way more than we had originally planned. The ambience, level of service and quality of food made this one of our most memorable dining experiences ever - it was so good that we came back the next night and none of the magic was lost. It also said a lot that there were faces that we had seen the previous night who were there again also.To the owners - you are lucky to have such wonderful people working at your restaurant. Along with the incredible food that you serve, they make the whole experience first class. Ruel in particular is a huge asset and we loved the way he took care of us on both nights that we visited. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Barcelona!  \n",

We had great seafood for our first visit: clams, scallops, fried small fish. When we came the second time, most seafood was run-out of stock: mussels, seafood plate ... We ended up having Spanish omelette and cod in honey sauce, which was not as tasty.  \n",

Since we've planned on a big dinner, we only wanted to order a Tapa or two. Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese & Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.  \n",

How? One waitress can change everything. He was not in the mood and affected our decisions. somehow we ordered something very weird. because of the language problems we didnt understand if we ordered something wrong or he didnt understand.   \n",

I appreciate this and had a great experience. Food was amazing and would go back anytime I can.  \n",

We ordered a couple of dishes, and expected a lot due to the reviews and recommendations from friends. All was amazing besides the razor clams, I expected a little more from the razor clams. People were nice, and our waiter was very knowledgeable. We will return again to give this another try.  \n",

Stumbled upon this restaurant that had people spilling out the door. Good that I was solo because the helpful hostess and servers at the bar got me seated immediately and I was so glad because I was able to meet Ruel, William, Jordi and a younger, cute fellow who had nickname but I can’t recall if they told me his real name. Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable. Overall the food was great, the Sangria top notch but it was the service that really sold me on the tapas place. I really hope I have some time to stop by again before my trip ends but I will be sure to come back the next time in Barcelona!  \n",

It's gotten a little touristy, but with patience you can find a table or a spot at the bar. You won't be disappointed by the quality, the variety and the prices of the tapas (i recommend shrimps). Also the sandwiches are really good.  \n",

HOWEVER, this is a tourist trap, with the worst service ever. First of all, the server acted like he didn't even want to be here. Second of all, he had ZERO knowledge about hygiene and food safety. When he brought out the first tapa ( mushrooms w egg yolk ), his thumb was touching the rim of the plate and nail was touching the mushroom. By the third tapa, he looked at me as his thumb touched the tomato bread. And he handed me a new plate with grease on it. Thinking about all the germs he had in his nails... YUCK.  \n",

The choice is enormous, every bite is heaven. And many people know this, and that is why this place during dinner times is absolutely loaded. The first time I had to come back for a table at 23:30 (thank god Barcelona had crazy dinner times). Normally between 16-17 in the afternoon you can find a place at the bar. Anyway, when in Barcelona, don't miss this place.  \n",

Some dishes better than others. Very friendly service. Worth booking places in advance as there is a long line. We sat outside but it seems that the better atmosphere is inside... we could not wait for our turn :(...  \n",

So after a long trip and an afternoon nap, this place was a great to taste several tapas, beer and wine. The razor clams are great among the other 10 tapas we tried. The nata dessert was also excellent and the service was great.   \n",

Too bad we only went there on our last night in town. Good food, great service staff. They were lively and made good recommendation for us to try. Service was quick too and we didnt have to wait long for food. However, this place is popular so go early if you want a good table. we sat outside in the cold, which was fine. Overall love this place. will be back  \n",

Thursday evening around six we were able to get a table immediately. Our server, Raquel, was very helpful explaining the differences between the tapas and mondtiditos. We ordered several items including sardines, crispy eggplant, mushrooms with asparagus codfish fritters and enjoyed everything. Two nites later we returned and Raquel remembered us. This time we tried garlic shrimp and a fried platter of squid, sardines and cuttlefish with mini poblanos plus a couple of “old favorites and a pitcher of sangria. Second dinner was even better and we then took Raquel’s dessert recommendation of bread pudding which is more of a soufflé with a creamy interior—scrumptious! Prices are very reasonable, service is quick and they are open from 9:30am to 1:30 am. If we return to Barcelona, we will return to Catalana  \n",

You can’t make a reservation, but if you eat around 6:30-7:00 you shouldn’t have much of a wait. When we left at 9:30, the line was out the door. They have a regular menu and a specials menu. A couple of dishes we wanted from the specials menu were already sold out. We loved the razor clams, the burrata salad and the ham and cheese mini sandwich the best, but everything we tried was good. Make sure to save room for the burnt St Joan bread pudding. Service was friendly and very efficient. We would definitely return.  \n",

First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.</td>\n",

Our table was called promptly when we came back so we didn’t have to wait. It is always very busy so make sure you are there when your name is called as I would imagine they don’t hold tables for long!The service was impeccable and very quick. The place is very buzzing and full of atmosphere, so it was great fun - but not the place for a quiet, leisurely meal.

The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!</td>\n",

There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it.

I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated.

Everything was amazing...the food, the service, and the atmosphere! The classic Spanish tapas like patatas bravas, pan con tomates, jamon iberico, and Spanish cheeses were wonderful as well as typical Catalan dishes like artichokes with shrimp and clams, fresh fried calamari, and crema catalana. Homemade sangria was perfect. Selection of wines by the glass was great. We will definitely be back here on our next trip. Best meal of the week in Barcelona!</td>\n",

When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling.

Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese &amp; Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.</td>\n",

Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable.

The garlic prawns with tomato bread were the best! I also had some ham/cheese tapas, a beer and finished with some churos. It was 25 euros so well worth it. Would definitely go back! The inside is more bright and modern than I was expecting but it had a nice atmosphere and great food.  \n",

High quality small dishes, with a very wide offer. It is always full, you need to queue. Go with plenty of time. The atmosphere is great, service is fast and prices are reasonable. You can have a taste of the local cuisine with several small dishes. You will not go there only once.  \n",

Very good place with quality food and very good treatment by the waiters. For dessert I ordered the crema catalana and it is the best I've ever tasted, it was only 2.95 euros, amazing!  \n",

Food comes very quickly, best to not order too much at the same time. Staff is friendly, however can appear a bit rushed as this place seems to have a waiting line outside most of the time. But really a must-try!  \n",

Me and my friend ordered a lot of things and we pay a very reasonable price. The service is also very good. I recommend it 100%.  \n",

We went back again to this restaurant a few days later and also one of it's sister restaurant Vinitus. :)  \n",

       "13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I was recommended this place for Tapas during TripAdvisor search. They don't do reservations but there is a waiting list outside. First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.  \n",

I went at the end of November with a colleague and they expanded the restaurant but the quality is still the same: Excellent!  \n",

They were very disorganized and look lost and desperate while taking care the long waiting line.The food is good but you can find other places better than this one in barcelona. I hope they can improve their service because the place is very nice.  \n",

The is absolutely the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona. The food is fantastic, the drinks and wine very good, and the overall experience is definitely value-for-money. The staff is very friendly and service minded. Its not possible to book a table, so I recommend come early or be prepared to wait for a while to be seated. Great Experience!  \n",

After all the waiting the waiter started to tell us off. What? Definitely not recommended. The system of listing people outside is a mess. They don’t do reservations and everyone is packed in the front of the restaurant. And the employees tell you off. Poor service.  \n",

IT WAS THAT GOOD. The front-of-house was really friendly and accommodating. There was a long line-up or queue but it was worth it! Raquel was our server and she was the best! She recommended a lot of their popular tapas, and they did not disappoint at all! It was so so good! The seafood was fresh and properly cooked, we had grilled figs that was so fresh, and mushrooms with egg yolk. It was all divine. Everything was served nice and hot. The garlic shrimp, galician clams, grilled cuttlefish, and many more, are definitely what to order. The staff was absolutely friendly.  \n",

We had a big table, they made us leave because someone else was coming. But in the same time they did not let us book a table earlier.   \n",

The food was fantastic - great quality, freshly cooked and quickly served. We had been told about this place by friends who had been before and it didn’t disappoint!You can’t book but you turn up and leave your name and they tell you roughly how long until your table is ready, so you can nip off for a drink nearby then come back, which is what we did. Our table was called promptly when we came back so we didn’t have to wait. It is always very busy so make sure you are there when your name is called as I would imagine they don’t hold tables for long!The service was impeccable and very quick. The place is very buzzing and full of atmosphere, so it was great fun - but not the place for a quiet, leisurely meal.

Each time we think of the city, this restaurant comes to mind first. The food is excellent and the best service.The staff are very nice. Price is reasonable. Yes, the line is often long but it's worth the wait. If/when we go back to Barcelona and this restaurant is the first stop!!  \n",

We waited about 25 minutes for a table at around 8.30pm on a Sunday evening. The staff were friendly, the restaurant was spotlessly clean and the food was excellent. The two of us shared some red prawns, razor clams, some beef and some whitebait, followed by a kind of bread pudding and churros, plus a jug of sangria. Everything was excellent.   \n",

What a fantastic find. Hugely popular, with quite a queue, but very well worth the wait. The razor clams were fabulous, as was the anchovy montadito, the croquettes, the burnt Sant Teresa torrija and the house chardonnay. Very reasonably priced. Sherwin (waiter) was excellent.  \n",

I ate around 13:30, so it may have been slow and too early, but everything just seemed slow and mediocre in the restaurant.I ordered 4 different types of tapas, and only liked 1 of the items.It's a very tourist-recommended location, but I'd suggest trying other local restaurants.  \n",

The Maitre d Rachez wasan incredible host. She made you feel great even if their was a wait. The food was incredible. We had multiple Shrimp types, Potatas Bravas, beef tenderloin, mini burgers, calamari, fist, etc. The sangria was to die for. One thing to note was that there were 3 other girls who waited on us - Cherry, Elsie, and Vangie. When the were not running plates, they were busy getting the place in order (moving plates, cleaning up, etc.) Thank you Girls - You run that joint. Overall, we loved it here and would go back again and again.  \n",

It has a good location, a buzz about it, and clearly has excellent word of mouth. We came a few years ago, and have just returned this weekend. Over the years we have recommended it to many people.You go outside, put your name on the list, get told your waiting time, and come back after having had a drink elsewhere. Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!  \n",

I want to share my disappointment with this place. They have bad service and terrible food. We ordered several tapas, but the waitress decided he was not going to place all the order. When we asked why he didn't bring all the order out he said then that we don't live in SLAVE time anymore. I was so surprised with his answer, so I requested to please speak with the manager. We found out he waa the manager. He moved on with screaming, yelling and behaving as a terrible person and forgot his service job. We left that place and will NEVER return. Don't waste your time and money place, find instead the other better tapas places in Barcelona.  \n",

It was our first time trying tapas and we weren’t sure what to order so the waiter ordered for us. All of his suggestions were finger-licking good, the dessert too! Will definitely be coming back more often.  \n",

Some of the dishes change daily, but we thought they were all great (some pictures attached). Our particular favourite was the cabreaos eggs (spicy eggs), which is a bit of a play on eggs and chips ( and like 6 euro !)We tried most of the menu, and particularly loved all the seafood (and the tomato bread !) We will DEFINITELY be coming back here when we return to Barcelona!  \n",

Expunge for the quality we’ve received. Also we ordered a dish saying salat included and it arrived without it.

The place is generally crowded and there is a long waiting line (I went a week ago and tables were very spaced out, more relaxed and we were admitted quickly, these changes are due to covid) despite this, IT IS AMAZING and very, very, very worth it. The food is beyond incredible and dinning is an experience, fast paced and with many tapas ordered, it is fun, enjoyable and very exciting. I will never stop recommending it for locals or tourists. I have heard immaculate reviews from others. Definitely go if you have the oportunity :)  \n",

This is the first time that I'm really suspicious to a rating on TripAdvisor. How on earth can a restaurant like this have 4,5 with over 12 000 ratings. That is a mystery for me. The service was really a disgrace and the food was OK, nothing more. We were given a menu that was printed out on a paper and the printing black ink was faded on the menu so we couldn't read all of the menu and we couldn't see the prizes. When I told the waiter this he just showed me that all the menus were like that. Hahaha!And the dishes on the menu had no description so you had no idea what some of the stuff was or any sort of detail to it. There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it. We went away both hungry and just laughing at the entire experience. This was definitely our first and last time here.Spare your money and go to other restaurants that a actually great - there are plenty of them in Barcelona.   \n",

So Very Uncool. Especially that they didnt even try to find us other solution.Positiv: -8pm we could get a table without waiting-2 delicious tapas: sirloin and potatoes with eggs (all other tapas we took was maximum average quality)I was expected much better from this many positive feedbacks but I wouldnt come back here to eat. It would have been nicer in a smaller bar or restaurant where they care about the costumers.  \n",

Great service, fast. I recommend to visit and try catalan cream, tomato bread, all tapas.  \n",

We ended up here for breakfast every day! Great, simple breakfast menu with fantastically reasonable prices! We had lunch here one day too but for us breakfast stole the show! Always busy so be prepared to wait a bit but it was worth it for us!  \n",

But if you don't present full they won't let you sit on the table.Totally absence of Customer centricity.I have already arranged a business meeting in that place otherwise I would spare my money there   \n",

Always a pleasure! Great local food, always fresh, always tasty. Each time we've tried something else in the menu.This time we've set on the bar and had a great \"closer\" service experience as well.Until next time....  \n",
       "53   I have been going to this restaurant ever since I arrived in Barcelona 2 years ago and have recommended it to many of my colleagues and friends. However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET ROBBED WHILE ENJOYING YOUR MEAL AND THEN TREATED LIKE YOU ARE A THIEF AND TOLD YOU MUST NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU PAY THEN GO AHEAD AND EAT HERE.  \n",

I visited this place for the first time 8 years ago and now the plates are much smaller and the prices much higher, so I was a bit dissapointed during my second visit :/  \n",

When he stopped because he couldn’t walk more (just for a minute or some seconds) they couldn’t stop telling me rudely to move him out of the way because he was “bothering”. I understand they need to walk fast without obstacles and everything, but he was just laying down and annoying nobody. Unless they can cure him I can’t do anything else apart from waiting, but it’s not necessary to be so rude for just a sick dog that can’t move and needs to rest.Never gonna eat there ever again.  \n",

Exactly what I was expecting from a local tapas place. Ok you have to wait 20min to get a table but don't give up.Menu: there are so many tapas that you can go crazy and order more than you can handle! My recommendation: Bacalau, Boquerones en vinagre and andaluze, NavajasPrice: in couple we totally spent 62eur for 12 tapas, 2 glasses of wine and bottle of water.We were full and satisfied.  \n",

Although we have been there twice without reservations, it’s recommended to make reservations ... or be lucky like we were.They have an elaborate selection of small (tapas) and main dishes, really allowing to satisfy each taste and preference.Service is efficient, fast and quite friendly.The quality of the food, the size of the portions and the presentation are proof of the professionalism of this place.Prices are midrange and ok for what you get.Will go back.  \n",

I wanted to experience for myself what he saw and tasted. My family and I walked twice towards this restaurant for dinner! Both times we came out very satisfied and happy. Food is here is very good brought to our table by a very friendly staff. Love the service here and price is reasonable. Don't think twice. Come here. Order grilled red prawns and steak with foie gras, among many other good things-you will be happy, promise!  \n",

Everything was amazing...the food, the service, and the atmosphere! The classic Spanish tapas like patatas bravas, pan con tomates, jamon iberico, and Spanish cheeses were wonderful as well as typical Catalan dishes like artichokes with shrimp and clams, fresh fried calamari, and crema catalana. Homemade sangria was perfect. Selection of wines by the glass was great. We will definitely be back here on our next trip. Best meal of the week in Barcelona!  \n",

It did not disappoint. Great energy, vibe and food was delicious. Try the skinny fries covered in an aioli with an egg on top. Sounds simple but was very tasty.   \n",

Arrived at about 8pm and were told there was a 30 minute wait for a table. After a drink at the bar we were called to our table after about 20 minutes. It was well worth the wait! Great food, great service and all reasonably priced. Very busy, great vibe/atmosphere, would go back again tomorrow if we could!!!!  \n",

Twice the wait was about an hour long and once 30 minutes. We saw large number of people waiting on all occasions.Having said all that, the food is quite good. We tried a variety of tapas on each occasions and most were quite tasty. Price was fairly reasonable to us too. milespointstravel.com  \n",

There was a short wait, but we were able to get seats the counter after just a few minutes. The service was prompt and professional. We enjoyed a liter of sangria with a steady flow of tapas. We tried many things, but especially enjoyed the garlic shrimp and the bombas - you definitely need to try the bombas! Would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona!  \n",

The food was ok, but not tasty. I don’t recommend.  \n",

The Tapas are very nice . Everything is very tasty and there is a big variety of fish food .The wine was also very nice and the desert . You can also sit at the bar to drink your wine or beer and eat a tapas. You need to reserve a table otherwise in rash hour you must wait more than an hour .   \n",

But it really worth it. The food is at very reasonable price and very tasty.  \n",

What an amazing meal. Came here on recommendation and did not disappoint. Busy packed place. Expect to wait for few minutes. Maybe if you sit at bar. Sat at bar and had front view of dishes tapas. Had 8 tapas. Steak to prawns to shrimp peppers to codfish the best. To more double takings. Amazing taste and affordable price. 9 tapas for 30 euros plus a beer. Not bad. Come here for a local busy pack place to eat and enjoy the crowd.   \n",

The tapas as amazing! Their options are reasonably priced for their serving, and everything was delicious. The server recommended Solomillo de ternera con foie (Beef tenderloin with foie gras) and it was an absolutely precious. The staff is super helpful and efficient, excellent service. I’d go back here. I will fly back to Barcelona to eat here. Expect a queue for dinner, but who can blame them? This is a great place!  \n",

The best we ever had in Spain. We ate there 7 times.Tried all seafood and mushrooms, even the potato and grilled peppers. All good.Wish they had a menu like in the Japanese restaurants with photos. I only know a limited Spanish. of course you can google the dishes and check what others order.  \n",

The prices are a bit expensive (2-4 euro for one open sandwich), but the food is seriously high quality. Definitely make a reservation as we came and it was packed out the front door. We were seated outside but still received pretty good and fast service, enough for my girlfriend and I to have enough time to hang out and chat over the food.  \n",

We made a reservation for 12 people, but at first we were in 11, waiting for one more to arrive. In the begining the waiters were already rude, but as we were there for a nice time with Friends, we didnt want to make a big thing from that. But the episodes started to occur, for instance, when one of the waiters complained because we were not ordering all the things for once (we were in a group of 11 and we were eating tapas, so no way everybody would order at the same time). When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling. At this time we couldnt stand the situation anymore and stood up to leave. The manager probably realized he and his team f***ed up and told us to stay because he was putting another chair for our friend. Too little too late. WORST EXPERIENCE IN A RESTAURANT IN MY WHOLE LIFE.  \n",

From the begging the waiters were very rude, throwing our orders at the table and putting very strange pressure for us to order fast and in the order they wanted. We had a table for 12 people but were 11. When our 12th friend arrived, they started saying it was not possible for him to sit and started counting the number of us, as if we would be cheating wrt the number of people!! We were consuming a lot and yet receiving awful service!Pathetic.  \n",

And by the time the 12th person arrive the staff did not get a chair for her. Believe or not the manager started to count the number of people.Terrible felling as tourist....  \n",

We went there for lunch and enjoyed everything we've ordered. A large selection of Tapas could be found here. we've tried Patatas Bravas, Foie Gras with tenderloin, Shrimp Skewers and many more.  The food was fantastic. We couldn't help but to come here again for dinner during our short stay in Barcelona. It is definitely our first choice when it comes to Tapas.  \n",

If you prefer o sit at the table, you have to wait. You can be lucky and get the place at bar, which is not a bad alternative at all.Food is amazingly taste. Really difficult to choose the best one. After eating of the first pieces, you will think to order all menu. Just go there and enjoy...  \n",

This place is very popular and very busy but is it the authentic Spanish tapas experience? I think not. Perhaps go here if you have a large group or you are on a bus tour. The atmosphere is loud, brightly lit and like that of a cafeteria (maybe a wee bit nicer). The quality of the food is fair but the staff are determined to get people in and out as quickly as they can. Prices are high. Credit to the staff who are working very hard.  \n",

I think the only difference is a slightly smaller wait time (5-10 minutes) and the name on the building. I love the tapas here. Try it all, you cannot go wrong. The albariño wines are my favorite and pair well with almost everything on the menu.  \n",

The waiter who served us was helpful, though his colleague spoke little English, and was extremely brisk.There was a large number of asian tourists here; not a bad thing, but indicative of the market it caters for and the price hike as a result.The food was uniformly excellent. The fried green peppers were an unexpected delight. If money is no object, then go crazy and I'm sure you'll have a ball.  \n",

Be there early to get a sit straight away and a good time to eat the menu ! Staff are all professional meaning they rush at 100 miles an hour to serve everyone . The food is fabulous. Have not had one bad dish .  \n",

Only down side is how crowded it gets at 20h onwards and the long waiting cue at dinner time.  \n",

The selection of tapas we ordered were all great and the portion was quite big. Service is great and most staff can speak English...  \n",

And I remember having to stand (for an hour) behind someone at the counter just to secure a narrow spot for myself.But the Philippino who served me was super nice (as our countries are neighbours ).Overall it was such a lovely time and of course the yummylicious food. I went back there again the next day with a friend and yep, we still had to wait for an hour but it was a pleasant experience ❤️  \n",

English speaking. No vegan options but for those without dietary concerns or budget issues this is a great place  \n",

Not anything amazing but make sure to try calcots (grilled leeks served with romesco sauce) if there in Winter. Staff were a little bit pushy in trying to get us to have dessert.   \n",

I'm sure others would love the place and the ambiance - but it certainly wasn't to our taste...  \n",

The Codfish Fritters (daily special) were outstanding - best I’ve ever had. Very busy place, so go early.  \n",

Special thanks to Ruel! Such a friendly and positive waiter. Ask his recommendations, every dish he suggested was absolutely fabulous. My top three:- cod with honey and tomatoes;- beef with foie gras;- camembert with almonds and berries.  \n",

It was pretty packed outside and inside. Being there for the first time, we did not know where or how we could get into the queue for a table. Therefore went inside and was told off by the queue lady because we were standing on the wrong side of where we were supposed to be. Brushed that off as them being flustered due to the high number of customers but a bit of signage to let customers know where to queue would be helpful (and perhaps a little more service training for the queue lady would be awesome)Got in the queue, was told 30-45 mins. As there were a few customers in front that left, we promptly got a table. The waitress we had was patient and helpful with our orders. Food came out pretty quickly although there were some pretty hefty gaps between some orders (10-15 mins??)We tried re-ordering from a tall man with glasses but was told to “wait” and he never came back. He was constantly shaking his head at other customers after taking their orders so we took our next order with another server. Service was pretty patchy depending on which moody (or happy) person you got. Food highlights (we ordered 8 tapas for 2 people for €66.30 euro)- Cod with honey “allioli”- Beef tenderloin with foie gras- Crispy camembert- Shrimp “al ajillo”  \n",

There was such a variety of great, authentic Spanish food and we enjoyed absolutely all of it! We came back two days in a row and would be glad to return again and again! Can’t wait for friends and family to visit Spain so we can show them some EXCELLENT food :P  \n",

Best tapas- the filet with froe gras is the best I’ve ever had, grilled shrimp are delicious, and potatoes with aoli are heavenly. Reasonable prices on outstanding food, and good wine. Despite no reservations and long lines with typical waits of an hour at mealtime, it was totally worth the wait.  \n",

Grilled clams and prawns are quite good. My favorite tapas here is grilled tenderloin with foie, which is very tasty.The service is so so because this is a very busy place. The waiter forgot one of my orders.  \n",

Dinner services was average cause once we sit down we order a bottle of champagne. Lunch was in very poor services. Coffee waited for 20mins. Requested to order thought 4 staff still no one come. We tried to order signature grill octopus but the manager said only a word “no” till we saw other tables have it then another staff helped to order. What a service! Don’t understand why they need to provide such service as we are very polite. The key point is all food weren’t hot just a bit warm or even in room temperature.  \n",

We went to quite a few tapas bars- each unique. But nothing compares to the variety, service, taste and ease of ordering for non- Spanish speakers. The restaurant was recommended (again) by locals who enjoy it tooThe fillet looked amazing but we weren’t in mood for meat.  \n",

However, the tapas were very ordinary but the desserts stood out. In fact, the desserts were very impressive. I would say, just go for the foie gras with tenderloin tapas and the desserts (coconut pudding and the bread pudding!!)  \n",

They make you feel at ease when you’re eating there and the Filipino servers do know how to suggest what tapas to have and drinks to take. The server Ruel at the bar really knows what’s the fresh catch of the day are so when you’re there for the first time try to seat at the bar. Definitely, it’s worth the experience.  \n",

Great atmosphere and great service. Made our first night in Barcelona special. Yes a little on the expensive side but well worth it. Highly recommend   \n",

We ordered quite a lot of different tapas and we weren’t disappointed with any of them. All delicious and tasty. I’m always surprised at how reasonable the costs are in restaurants in Barcelona. I find them much cheaper than UK restaurants. It was roughly €120 for 5 people - we must have had 10 tapas and a paella for 2 to share with a small jug of sangria, 2 beers and several cokes. Staff were attentive, friendly and accommodating. All round great experience.  \n",

Maybe better less crowded options at same price point - not worth more than a ten minute wait - it’s just not  \n",

I am glad to say it did not disappoint! Arriving with our tired 5 year old we were treated incredibly well and the lady at the front along with Ruel made a special effort to seat us quickly. Fortunately we got sat at the bar and Ruel made us feel very special right away, giving us tips on what we should try and being so attentive, it was like he could read our minds! All of the dishes we tried were incredible and we came away eating and drinking way more than we had originally planned. The ambience, level of service and quality of food made this one of our most memorable dining experiences ever - it was so good that we came back the next night and none of the magic was lost. It also said a lot that there were faces that we had seen the previous night who were there again also.To the owners - you are lucky to have such wonderful people working at your restaurant. Along with the incredible food that you serve, they make the whole experience first class. Ruel in particular is a huge asset and we loved the way he took care of us on both nights that we visited. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Barcelona!  \n",

We had great seafood for our first visit: clams, scallops, fried small fish. When we came the second time, most seafood was run-out of stock: mussels, seafood plate ... We ended up having Spanish omelette and cod in honey sauce, which was not as tasty.  \n",

Since we've planned on a big dinner, we only wanted to order a Tapa or two. Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese & Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.  \n",

How? One waitress can change everything. He was not in the mood and affected our decisions. somehow we ordered something very weird. because of the language problems we didnt understand if we ordered something wrong or he didnt understand.   \n",

I appreciate this and had a great experience. Food was amazing and would go back anytime I can.  \n",

We ordered a couple of dishes, and expected a lot due to the reviews and recommendations from friends. All was amazing besides the razor clams, I expected a little more from the razor clams. People were nice, and our waiter was very knowledgeable. We will return again to give this another try.  \n",

Stumbled upon this restaurant that had people spilling out the door. Good that I was solo because the helpful hostess and servers at the bar got me seated immediately and I was so glad because I was able to meet Ruel, William, Jordi and a younger, cute fellow who had nickname but I can’t recall if they told me his real name. Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable. Overall the food was great, the Sangria top notch but it was the service that really sold me on the tapas place. I really hope I have some time to stop by again before my trip ends but I will be sure to come back the next time in Barcelona!  \n",

It's gotten a little touristy, but with patience you can find a table or a spot at the bar. You won't be disappointed by the quality, the variety and the prices of the tapas (i recommend shrimps). Also the sandwiches are really good.  \n",

HOWEVER, this is a tourist trap, with the worst service ever. First of all, the server acted like he didn't even want to be here. Second of all, he had ZERO knowledge about hygiene and food safety. When he brought out the first tapa ( mushrooms w egg yolk ), his thumb was touching the rim of the plate and nail was touching the mushroom. By the third tapa, he looked at me as his thumb touched the tomato bread. And he handed me a new plate with grease on it. Thinking about all the germs he had in his nails... YUCK.  \n",

The choice is enormous, every bite is heaven. And many people know this, and that is why this place during dinner times is absolutely loaded. The first time I had to come back for a table at 23:30 (thank god Barcelona had crazy dinner times). Normally between 16-17 in the afternoon you can find a place at the bar. Anyway, when in Barcelona, don't miss this place.  \n",

Some dishes better than others. Very friendly service. Worth booking places in advance as there is a long line. We sat outside but it seems that the better atmosphere is inside... we could not wait for our turn :(...  \n",

So after a long trip and an afternoon nap, this place was a great to taste several tapas, beer and wine. The razor clams are great among the other 10 tapas we tried. The nata dessert was also excellent and the service was great.   \n",

Too bad we only went there on our last night in town. Good food, great service staff. They were lively and made good recommendation for us to try. Service was quick too and we didnt have to wait long for food. However, this place is popular so go early if you want a good table. we sat outside in the cold, which was fine. Overall love this place. will be back  \n",

Thursday evening around six we were able to get a table immediately. Our server, Raquel, was very helpful explaining the differences between the tapas and mondtiditos. We ordered several items including sardines, crispy eggplant, mushrooms with asparagus codfish fritters and enjoyed everything. Two nites later we returned and Raquel remembered us. This time we tried garlic shrimp and a fried platter of squid, sardines and cuttlefish with mini poblanos plus a couple of “old favorites and a pitcher of sangria. Second dinner was even better and we then took Raquel’s dessert recommendation of bread pudding which is more of a soufflé with a creamy interior—scrumptious! Prices are very reasonable, service is quick and they are open from 9:30am to 1:30 am. If we return to Barcelona, we will return to Catalana  \n",

You can’t make a reservation, but if you eat around 6:30-7:00 you shouldn’t have much of a wait. When we left at 9:30, the line was out the door. They have a regular menu and a specials menu. A couple of dishes we wanted from the specials menu were already sold out. We loved the razor clams, the burrata salad and the ham and cheese mini sandwich the best, but everything we tried was good. Make sure to save room for the burnt St Joan bread pudding. Service was friendly and very efficient. We would definitely return.  \n",

First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.</td>\n",

Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!</td>\n",

Hahaha!And the dishes on the menu had no description so you had no idea what some of the stuff was or any sort of detail to it. There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it.

However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET ROBBED WHILE ENJOYING YOUR MEAL AND THEN TREATED LIKE YOU ARE A THIEF AND TOLD YOU MUST NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU PAY THEN GO AHEAD AND EAT HERE.</td>\n",

But the episodes started to occur, for instance, when one of the waiters complained because we were not ordering all the things for once (we were in a group of 11 and we were eating tapas, so no way everybody would order at the same time). When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling. At this time we couldnt stand the situation anymore and stood up to leave.

Arriving with our tired 5 year old we were treated incredibly well and the lady at the front along with Ruel made a special effort to seat us quickly. Fortunately we got sat at the bar and Ruel made us feel very special right away, giving us tips on what we should try and being so attentive, it was like he could read our minds! All of the dishes we tried were incredible and we came away eating and drinking way more than we had originally planned. The ambience, level of service and quality of food made this one of our most memorable dining experiences ever - it was so good that we came back the next night and none of the magic was lost. It also said a lot that there were faces that we had seen the previous night who were there again also.To the owners - you are lucky to have such wonderful people working at your restaurant. Along with the incredible food that you serve, they make the whole experience first class. Ruel in particular is a huge asset and we loved the way he took care of us on both nights that we visited. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Barcelona!</td>\n",

Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese &amp; Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.</td>\n",

Good that I was solo because the helpful hostess and servers at the bar got me seated immediately and I was so glad because I was able to meet Ruel, William, Jordi and a younger, cute fellow who had nickname but I can’t recall if they told me his real name. Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable. Overall the food was great, the Sangria top notch but it was the service that really sold me on the tapas place.

The garlic prawns with tomato bread were the best! I also had some ham/cheese tapas, a beer and finished with some churos. It was 25 euros so well worth it. Would definitely go back! The inside is more bright and modern than I was expecting but it had a nice atmosphere and great food.   \n",

High quality small dishes, with a very wide offer. It is always full, you need to queue. Go with plenty of time. The atmosphere is great, service is fast and prices are reasonable. You can have a taste of the local cuisine with several small dishes. You will not go there only once.   \n",

Very good place with quality food and very good treatment by the waiters. For dessert I ordered the crema catalana and it is the best I've ever tasted, it was only 2.95 euros, amazing!   \n",

Food comes very quickly, best to not order too much at the same time. Staff is friendly, however can appear a bit rushed as this place seems to have a waiting line outside most of the time. But really a must-try!   \n",

We went back again to this restaurant a few days later and also one of it's sister restaurant Vinitus. :)   \n",

       "13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I was recommended this place for Tapas during TripAdvisor search. They don't do reservations but there is a waiting list outside. First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.   \n",

I went at the end of November with a colleague and they expanded the restaurant but the quality is still the same: Excellent!   \n",

They were very disorganized and look lost and desperate while taking care the long waiting line.The food is good but you can find other places better than this one in barcelona. I hope they can improve their service because the place is very nice.   \n",

The is absolutely the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona. The food is fantastic, the drinks and wine very good, and the overall experience is definitely value-for-money. The staff is very friendly and service minded. Its not possible to book a table, so I recommend come early or be prepared to wait for a while to be seated. Great Experience!   \n",

After all the waiting the waiter started to tell us off. What? Definitely not recommended. The system of listing people outside is a mess. They don’t do reservations and everyone is packed in the front of the restaurant. And the employees tell you off. Poor service.   \n",

IT WAS THAT GOOD. The front-of-house was really friendly and accommodating. There was a long line-up or queue but it was worth it! Raquel was our server and she was the best! She recommended a lot of their popular tapas, and they did not disappoint at all! It was so so good! The seafood was fresh and properly cooked, we had grilled figs that was so fresh, and mushrooms with egg yolk. It was all divine. Everything was served nice and hot. The garlic shrimp, galician clams, grilled cuttlefish, and many more, are definitely what to order. The staff was absolutely friendly.   \n",

We had a big table, they made us leave because someone else was coming. But in the same time they did not let us book a table earlier.    \n",

The food was fantastic - great quality, freshly cooked and quickly served. We had been told about this place by friends who had been before and it didn’t disappoint!You can’t book but you turn up and leave your name and they tell you roughly how long until your table is ready, so you can nip off for a drink nearby then come back, which is what we did. Our table was called promptly when we came back so we didn’t have to wait. It is always very busy so make sure you are there when your name is called as I would imagine they don’t hold tables for long!The service was impeccable and very quick. The place is very buzzing and full of atmosphere, so it was great fun - but not the place for a quiet, leisurely meal.

Each time we think of the city, this restaurant comes to mind first. The food is excellent and the best service.The staff are very nice. Price is reasonable. Yes, the line is often long but it's worth the wait. If/when we go back to Barcelona and this restaurant is the first stop!!   \n",

We waited about 25 minutes for a table at around 8.30pm on a Sunday evening. The staff were friendly, the restaurant was spotlessly clean and the food was excellent. The two of us shared some red prawns, razor clams, some beef and some whitebait, followed by a kind of bread pudding and churros, plus a jug of sangria. Everything was excellent.    \n",

What a fantastic find. Hugely popular, with quite a queue, but very well worth the wait. The razor clams were fabulous, as was the anchovy montadito, the croquettes, the burnt Sant Teresa torrija and the house chardonnay. Very reasonably priced. Sherwin (waiter) was excellent.   \n",

I ate around 13:30, so it may have been slow and too early, but everything just seemed slow and mediocre in the restaurant.I ordered 4 different types of tapas, and only liked 1 of the items.It's a very tourist-recommended location, but I'd suggest trying other local restaurants.   \n",

The Maitre d Rachez wasan incredible host. She made you feel great even if their was a wait. The food was incredible. We had multiple Shrimp types, Potatas Bravas, beef tenderloin, mini burgers, calamari, fist, etc. The sangria was to die for. One thing to note was that there were 3 other girls who waited on us - Cherry, Elsie, and Vangie. When the were not running plates, they were busy getting the place in order (moving plates, cleaning up, etc.) Thank you Girls - You run that joint. Overall, we loved it here and would go back again and again.   \n",

It has a good location, a buzz about it, and clearly has excellent word of mouth. We came a few years ago, and have just returned this weekend. Over the years we have recommended it to many people.You go outside, put your name on the list, get told your waiting time, and come back after having had a drink elsewhere. Good system.The food, is pretty incredible, especially the huevos cabreados and the honey cod! The wine is also fantastic.My issue, only issue, with this restaurant, is that they are so keen to get you fed, and outside again (so that they can speed up the customer turnover and prevent too many being disappointed at the wait time?) that it felt like a bit of a fast food experience. We had to send out croquettes back, after they’d arrived suspiciously quickly, because they were cold in the middle. Good manners and Britishness prevented us from sending them back a second time, as they still arrived “Luke warm”. The second you finished the last bite of the dish it was gone from in front of you. The serving staff were practically running around serving people.We know it’s busy. We know it’s delicious. How do you strike the right balance to ensure that people don’t feel rushed? Maybe longer waiting times, and manage people’s expectations?We would return, and we’d continue to recommend, but we’d tell people not to be rushed. Don’t let them rush you!   \n",

I want to share my disappointment with this place. They have bad service and terrible food. We ordered several tapas, but the waitress decided he was not going to place all the order. When we asked why he didn't bring all the order out he said then that we don't live in SLAVE time anymore. I was so surprised with his answer, so I requested to please speak with the manager. We found out he waa the manager. He moved on with screaming, yelling and behaving as a terrible person and forgot his service job. We left that place and will NEVER return. Don't waste your time and money place, find instead the other better tapas places in Barcelona.   \n",

It was our first time trying tapas and we weren’t sure what to order so the waiter ordered for us. All of his suggestions were finger-licking good, the dessert too! Will definitely be coming back more often.   \n",

Some of the dishes change daily, but we thought they were all great (some pictures attached). Our particular favourite was the cabreaos eggs (spicy eggs), which is a bit of a play on eggs and chips ( and like 6 euro !)We tried most of the menu, and particularly loved all the seafood (and the tomato bread !) We will DEFINITELY be coming back here when we return to Barcelona!   \n",

Expunge for the quality we’ve received. Also we ordered a dish saying salat included and it arrived without it.

The place is generally crowded and there is a long waiting line (I went a week ago and tables were very spaced out, more relaxed and we were admitted quickly, these changes are due to covid) despite this, IT IS AMAZING and very, very, very worth it. The food is beyond incredible and dinning is an experience, fast paced and with many tapas ordered, it is fun, enjoyable and very exciting. I will never stop recommending it for locals or tourists. I have heard immaculate reviews from others. Definitely go if you have the oportunity :)   \n",

This is the first time that I'm really suspicious to a rating on TripAdvisor. How on earth can a restaurant like this have 4,5 with over 12 000 ratings. That is a mystery for me. The service was really a disgrace and the food was OK, nothing more. We were given a menu that was printed out on a paper and the printing black ink was faded on the menu so we couldn't read all of the menu and we couldn't see the prizes. When I told the waiter this he just showed me that all the menus were like that. Hahaha!And the dishes on the menu had no description so you had no idea what some of the stuff was or any sort of detail to it. There was no chance to ask the waiter either because he was in constant hurry and could minimal English.When we finally got our food he almost just tossed it on the table. And at one time he just came behind me and scared me so I spilled some Sangria on my clothes in which he says: \"No worries\".One of the dishes said something like \"tacos beef\" so we thought that it had something to do with Tacos. Since the dishes had no detail explanation we got something that didn't have anything to do with tacos. I first thought they gave us someday else's dish. They explained what dish this was so I said that it's OK, they can take it, there was not even a \"sorry\" or any other suggestion that they can do something else. They just took the dish away without saying anything. Hahaha what a joke!The only thing that was good was the dessert and that's it. We went away both hungry and just laughing at the entire experience. This was definitely our first and last time here.Spare your money and go to other restaurants that a actually great - there are plenty of them in Barcelona.    \n",

So Very Uncool. Especially that they didnt even try to find us other solution.Positiv: -8pm we could get a table without waiting-2 delicious tapas: sirloin and potatoes with eggs (all other tapas we took was maximum average quality)I was expected much better from this many positive feedbacks but I wouldnt come back here to eat. It would have been nicer in a smaller bar or restaurant where they care about the costumers.   \n",

Great service, fast. I recommend to visit and try catalan cream, tomato bread, all tapas.   \n",

We ended up here for breakfast every day! Great, simple breakfast menu with fantastically reasonable prices! We had lunch here one day too but for us breakfast stole the show! Always busy so be prepared to wait a bit but it was worth it for us!   \n",

But if you don't present full they won't let you sit on the table.Totally absence of Customer centricity.I have already arranged a business meeting in that place otherwise I would spare my money there    \n",

Always a pleasure! Great local food, always fresh, always tasty. Each time we've tried something else in the menu.This time we've set on the bar and had a great \"closer\" service experience as well.Until next time....   \n",
       "53   I have been going to this restaurant ever since I arrived in Barcelona 2 years ago and have recommended it to many of my colleagues and friends. However, the other day I had a terrible experience which has changed my whole opinion of the place. I was sat outside and my bag containing all of my belongings was stolen as I was eating. I had returned from my holiday and ALL of my belongings were in the bag including my house keys, ID, credit cards, cash etc, the only thing I had was my phone. At first, the staff were very polite and concerned for me. I was stressed about how I was going to pay for the meal and the front of house lady told me not to worry, that it was on the house and to just block my cards. After some time on the phone to different banks, it started raining and so they moved me inside where I was then told by an older gentleman that I would have to pay the bill before leaving, despite what the woman had told me as well as the fact that I had NOTHING to pay with. I told the man that the lady had said it was on the house which she then lied about! She said that she never said that as she doesn't have the authority to do so (a complete lie!). Nevertheless I tried everything I could to pay in another form but after all attempts failed the only thing I could offer was to leave my details (I live here so I have a NIE number and everything) so I could come back the next day and pay but they still refused! I felt I was being treated like I was the thief! The man was extremely rude and told me \"no me hablas en ingles\", \"no te voy a hablar en ingles. Que me hablas en español\". He then went on to tell me that the only way I could leave was if I left my phone with him (which was the ONLY thing I had left and it was 11pm - I had no house keys no money nothing and am a young female!). I was completely shocked at his request and told him that I refuse. Eventually, after being completely humiliated by this gentleman in the middle of the restaurant and being treated like a thief after I was robbed on their premises, the man agreed to take my details. I returned the following morning once I'd been to the bank and paid them back. I didn't receive any sort of apology or even a thank you. I will NEVER return to this restaurant and am disgusted at the way I was treated. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET ROBBED WHILE ENJOYING YOUR MEAL AND THEN TREATED LIKE YOU ARE A THIEF AND TOLD YOU MUST NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU PAY THEN GO AHEAD AND EAT HERE.   \n",

I visited this place for the first time 8 years ago and now the plates are much smaller and the prices much higher, so I was a bit dissapointed during my second visit :/   \n",

When he stopped because he couldn’t walk more (just for a minute or some seconds) they couldn’t stop telling me rudely to move him out of the way because he was “bothering”. I understand they need to walk fast without obstacles and everything, but he was just laying down and annoying nobody. Unless they can cure him I can’t do anything else apart from waiting, but it’s not necessary to be so rude for just a sick dog that can’t move and needs to rest.Never gonna eat there ever again.   \n",

Exactly what I was expecting from a local tapas place. Ok you have to wait 20min to get a table but don't give up.Menu: there are so many tapas that you can go crazy and order more than you can handle! My recommendation: Bacalau, Boquerones en vinagre and andaluze, NavajasPrice: in couple we totally spent 62eur for 12 tapas, 2 glasses of wine and bottle of water.We were full and satisfied.   \n",

Although we have been there twice without reservations, it’s recommended to make reservations ... or be lucky like we were.They have an elaborate selection of small (tapas) and main dishes, really allowing to satisfy each taste and preference.Service is efficient, fast and quite friendly.The quality of the food, the size of the portions and the presentation are proof of the professionalism of this place.Prices are midrange and ok for what you get.Will go back.   \n",

I wanted to experience for myself what he saw and tasted. My family and I walked twice towards this restaurant for dinner! Both times we came out very satisfied and happy. Food is here is very good brought to our table by a very friendly staff. Love the service here and price is reasonable. Don't think twice. Come here. Order grilled red prawns and steak with foie gras, among many other good things-you will be happy, promise!   \n",

Everything was amazing...the food, the service, and the atmosphere! The classic Spanish tapas like patatas bravas, pan con tomates, jamon iberico, and Spanish cheeses were wonderful as well as typical Catalan dishes like artichokes with shrimp and clams, fresh fried calamari, and crema catalana. Homemade sangria was perfect. Selection of wines by the glass was great. We will definitely be back here on our next trip. Best meal of the week in Barcelona!   \n",

It did not disappoint. Great energy, vibe and food was delicious. Try the skinny fries covered in an aioli with an egg on top. Sounds simple but was very tasty.    \n",

It was always so busy in the evening we couldn’t get near the door! Full of locals - always the best recommendation!   \n",

Arrived at about 8pm and were told there was a 30 minute wait for a table. After a drink at the bar we were called to our table after about 20 minutes. It was well worth the wait! Great food, great service and all reasonably priced. Very busy, great vibe/atmosphere, would go back again tomorrow if we could!!!!   \n",

Twice the wait was about an hour long and once 30 minutes. We saw large number of people waiting on all occasions.Having said all that, the food is quite good. We tried a variety of tapas on each occasions and most were quite tasty. Price was fairly reasonable to us too. milespointstravel.com   \n",

There was a short wait, but we were able to get seats the counter after just a few minutes. The service was prompt and professional. We enjoyed a liter of sangria with a steady flow of tapas. We tried many things, but especially enjoyed the garlic shrimp and the bombas - you definitely need to try the bombas! Would recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona!   \n",

The Tapas are very nice . Everything is very tasty and there is a big variety of fish food .The wine was also very nice and the desert . You can also sit at the bar to drink your wine or beer and eat a tapas. You need to reserve a table otherwise in rash hour you must wait more than an hour .    \n",

What an amazing meal. Came here on recommendation and did not disappoint. Busy packed place. Expect to wait for few minutes. Maybe if you sit at bar. Sat at bar and had front view of dishes tapas. Had 8 tapas. Steak to prawns to shrimp peppers to codfish the best. To more double takings. Amazing taste and affordable price. 9 tapas for 30 euros plus a beer. Not bad. Come here for a local busy pack place to eat and enjoy the crowd.    \n",

The tapas as amazing! Their options are reasonably priced for their serving, and everything was delicious. The server recommended Solomillo de ternera con foie (Beef tenderloin with foie gras) and it was an absolutely precious. The staff is super helpful and efficient, excellent service. I’d go back here. I will fly back to Barcelona to eat here. Expect a queue for dinner, but who can blame them? This is a great place!   \n",

The best we ever had in Spain. We ate there 7 times.Tried all seafood and mushrooms, even the potato and grilled peppers. All good.Wish they had a menu like in the Japanese restaurants with photos. I only know a limited Spanish. of course you can google the dishes and check what others order.   \n",

The prices are a bit expensive (2-4 euro for one open sandwich), but the food is seriously high quality. Definitely make a reservation as we came and it was packed out the front door. We were seated outside but still received pretty good and fast service, enough for my girlfriend and I to have enough time to hang out and chat over the food.   \n",

We made a reservation for 12 people, but at first we were in 11, waiting for one more to arrive. In the begining the waiters were already rude, but as we were there for a nice time with Friends, we didnt want to make a big thing from that. But the episodes started to occur, for instance, when one of the waiters complained because we were not ordering all the things for once (we were in a group of 11 and we were eating tapas, so no way everybody would order at the same time). When we told them that, one of the waiters kept standing by our table mocking at our faces. Then they started to drop the orders in the table in a rough way, to make clear to us that we were not welcome. But the last thing we could not tolerate was when our last friend arrived and asked for a chair on the table. The waiter denied in a rude way. When we told our reservation was for 12 the waiter said we should complain with the manager. I asked him to call the manager, and when he arrived he was also rude, and started counting the people and insisted we were already on 12 (??????? yes he was miscounting on purpose to try to fool us) when we finaly convinced him he was counting wrong he started rumbling. At this time we couldnt stand the situation anymore and stood up to leave. The manager probably realized he and his team f***ed up and told us to stay because he was putting another chair for our friend. Too little too late. WORST EXPERIENCE IN A RESTAURANT IN MY WHOLE LIFE.   \n",

From the begging the waiters were very rude, throwing our orders at the table and putting very strange pressure for us to order fast and in the order they wanted. We had a table for 12 people but were 11. When our 12th friend arrived, they started saying it was not possible for him to sit and started counting the number of us, as if we would be cheating wrt the number of people!! We were consuming a lot and yet receiving awful service!Pathetic.   \n",

And by the time the 12th person arrive the staff did not get a chair for her. Believe or not the manager started to count the number of people.Terrible felling as tourist....   \n",

We went there for lunch and enjoyed everything we've ordered. A large selection of Tapas could be found here. we've tried Patatas Bravas, Foie Gras with tenderloin, Shrimp Skewers and many more.  The food was fantastic. We couldn't help but to come here again for dinner during our short stay in Barcelona. It is definitely our first choice when it comes to Tapas.   \n",

If you prefer o sit at the table, you have to wait. You can be lucky and get the place at bar, which is not a bad alternative at all.Food is amazingly taste. Really difficult to choose the best one. After eating of the first pieces, you will think to order all menu. Just go there and enjoy...   \n",

This place is very popular and very busy but is it the authentic Spanish tapas experience? I think not. Perhaps go here if you have a large group or you are on a bus tour. The atmosphere is loud, brightly lit and like that of a cafeteria (maybe a wee bit nicer). The quality of the food is fair but the staff are determined to get people in and out as quickly as they can. Prices are high. Credit to the staff who are working very hard.   \n",

I think the only difference is a slightly smaller wait time (5-10 minutes) and the name on the building. I love the tapas here. Try it all, you cannot go wrong. The albariño wines are my favorite and pair well with almost everything on the menu.   \n",

The waiter who served us was helpful, though his colleague spoke little English, and was extremely brisk.There was a large number of asian tourists here; not a bad thing, but indicative of the market it caters for and the price hike as a result.The food was uniformly excellent. The fried green peppers were an unexpected delight. If money is no object, then go crazy and I'm sure you'll have a ball.   \n",

Be there early to get a sit straight away and a good time to eat the menu ! Staff are all professional meaning they rush at 100 miles an hour to serve everyone . The food is fabulous. Have not had one bad dish .   \n",

Only down side is how crowded it gets at 20h onwards and the long waiting cue at dinner time.   \n",

The selection of tapas we ordered were all great and the portion was quite big. Service is great and most staff can speak English...   \n",

And I remember having to stand (for an hour) behind someone at the counter just to secure a narrow spot for myself.But the Philippino who served me was super nice (as our countries are neighbours ).Overall it was such a lovely time and of course the yummylicious food. I went back there again the next day with a friend and yep, we still had to wait for an hour but it was a pleasant experience ❤️   \n",

English speaking. No vegan options but for those without dietary concerns or budget issues this is a great place   \n",

Not anything amazing but make sure to try calcots (grilled leeks served with romesco sauce) if there in Winter. Staff were a little bit pushy in trying to get us to have dessert.    \n",

I'm sure others would love the place and the ambiance - but it certainly wasn't to our taste...   \n",

The Codfish Fritters (daily special) were outstanding - best I’ve ever had. Very busy place, so go early.   \n",

Special thanks to Ruel! Such a friendly and positive waiter. Ask his recommendations, every dish he suggested was absolutely fabulous. My top three:- cod with honey and tomatoes;- beef with foie gras;- camembert with almonds and berries.   \n",

It was pretty packed outside and inside. Being there for the first time, we did not know where or how we could get into the queue for a table. Therefore went inside and was told off by the queue lady because we were standing on the wrong side of where we were supposed to be. Brushed that off as them being flustered due to the high number of customers but a bit of signage to let customers know where to queue would be helpful (and perhaps a little more service training for the queue lady would be awesome)Got in the queue, was told 30-45 mins. As there were a few customers in front that left, we promptly got a table. The waitress we had was patient and helpful with our orders. Food came out pretty quickly although there were some pretty hefty gaps between some orders (10-15 mins??)We tried re-ordering from a tall man with glasses but was told to “wait” and he never came back. He was constantly shaking his head at other customers after taking their orders so we took our next order with another server. Service was pretty patchy depending on which moody (or happy) person you got. Food highlights (we ordered 8 tapas for 2 people for €66.30 euro)- Cod with honey “allioli”- Beef tenderloin with foie gras- Crispy camembert- Shrimp “al ajillo”   \n",

There was such a variety of great, authentic Spanish food and we enjoyed absolutely all of it! We came back two days in a row and would be glad to return again and again! Can’t wait for friends and family to visit Spain so we can show them some EXCELLENT food :P   \n",

Best tapas- the filet with froe gras is the best I’ve ever had, grilled shrimp are delicious, and potatoes with aoli are heavenly. Reasonable prices on outstanding food, and good wine. Despite no reservations and long lines with typical waits of an hour at mealtime, it was totally worth the wait.   \n",

Grilled clams and prawns are quite good. My favorite tapas here is grilled tenderloin with foie, which is very tasty.The service is so so because this is a very busy place. The waiter forgot one of my orders.   \n",

Dinner services was average cause once we sit down we order a bottle of champagne. Lunch was in very poor services. Coffee waited for 20mins. Requested to order thought 4 staff still no one come. We tried to order signature grill octopus but the manager said only a word “no” till we saw other tables have it then another staff helped to order. What a service! Don’t understand why they need to provide such service as we are very polite. The key point is all food weren’t hot just a bit warm or even in room temperature.   \n",

We went to quite a few tapas bars- each unique. But nothing compares to the variety, service, taste and ease of ordering for non- Spanish speakers. The restaurant was recommended (again) by locals who enjoy it tooThe fillet looked amazing but we weren’t in mood for meat.   \n",

However, the tapas were very ordinary but the desserts stood out. In fact, the desserts were very impressive. I would say, just go for the foie gras with tenderloin tapas and the desserts (coconut pudding and the bread pudding!!)   \n",

They make you feel at ease when you’re eating there and the Filipino servers do know how to suggest what tapas to have and drinks to take. The server Ruel at the bar really knows what’s the fresh catch of the day are so when you’re there for the first time try to seat at the bar. Definitely, it’s worth the experience.   \n",

Great atmosphere and great service. Made our first night in Barcelona special. Yes a little on the expensive side but well worth it. Highly recommend    \n",

We ordered quite a lot of different tapas and we weren’t disappointed with any of them. All delicious and tasty. I’m always surprised at how reasonable the costs are in restaurants in Barcelona. I find them much cheaper than UK restaurants. It was roughly €120 for 5 people - we must have had 10 tapas and a paella for 2 to share with a small jug of sangria, 2 beers and several cokes. Staff were attentive, friendly and accommodating. All round great experience.   \n",

Maybe better less crowded options at same price point - not worth more than a ten minute wait - it’s just not   \n",

I am glad to say it did not disappoint! Arriving with our tired 5 year old we were treated incredibly well and the lady at the front along with Ruel made a special effort to seat us quickly. Fortunately we got sat at the bar and Ruel made us feel very special right away, giving us tips on what we should try and being so attentive, it was like he could read our minds! All of the dishes we tried were incredible and we came away eating and drinking way more than we had originally planned. The ambience, level of service and quality of food made this one of our most memorable dining experiences ever - it was so good that we came back the next night and none of the magic was lost. It also said a lot that there were faces that we had seen the previous night who were there again also.To the owners - you are lucky to have such wonderful people working at your restaurant. Along with the incredible food that you serve, they make the whole experience first class. Ruel in particular is a huge asset and we loved the way he took care of us on both nights that we visited. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Barcelona!   \n",

We had great seafood for our first visit: clams, scallops, fried small fish. When we came the second time, most seafood was run-out of stock: mussels, seafood plate ... We ended up having Spanish omelette and cod in honey sauce, which was not as tasty.   \n",

Since we've planned on a big dinner, we only wanted to order a Tapa or two. Well, after seeing the choice and tasting the quality we couldn't stop ordering.But first you have to get a table. There are countless tables inside, and it's packed. Because we travel with our Bulldog and it was nice weather anyways we waited for a table outside. And it only took about 15' to get one. The lines - despite being long - move surprisingly fast.Staff here was really nice. Friendly and never pushy. You really can take your time to fully enjoy these wonderful Tapas here.Besides some more traditional items there are lots of Tapas with a twist. Very creative, very innovative. Freshly made with top-quality ingredients. And all that for very competitive prices. A bottle of Cava for just 16 Euros. Tapas starting as low as 2 bucks....Had Tapas with Salmon, with Anchovies, Cheese & Pineapple, a small plate of razor clams, small plate of diced steak and a scallop with melted cheese. And then - the best for last - the piece of steak topped with Foie Gras (think Steak Rossini). All of the items were very convincing, top-notch. Interestingly the steak with the foie gras was of better and more tender quality than the plate of diced steak. And the Steak/Foie Gras Combo was nothing short of amazing. The most tender meat and the Foie Gras cooked to perfection. It was melting in our mouths. Also the other Tapas and small plates were absolutely fantastic. But the steak/foie gras will be stuck in our heads until we come back here again.It's popular, it's busy....but for good reason. One of the very top restaurants we've eaten at on our 5-week Road Trip through Spain and Portugal. We will definitely be back.   \n",

How? One waitress can change everything. He was not in the mood and affected our decisions. somehow we ordered something very weird. because of the language problems we didnt understand if we ordered something wrong or he didnt understand.    \n",

I appreciate this and had a great experience. Food was amazing and would go back anytime I can.   \n",

We ordered a couple of dishes, and expected a lot due to the reviews and recommendations from friends. All was amazing besides the razor clams, I expected a little more from the razor clams. People were nice, and our waiter was very knowledgeable. We will return again to give this another try.   \n",

Stumbled upon this restaurant that had people spilling out the door. Good that I was solo because the helpful hostess and servers at the bar got me seated immediately and I was so glad because I was able to meet Ruel, William, Jordi and a younger, cute fellow who had nickname but I can’t recall if they told me his real name. Ruel was my main server and recommended so many tasty dishes that I was sad I don’t actually have a larger appetite. He was extremely attentive not just to me but the entire length of the bar making recommendations to everyone and being so kind. What struck me was how many languages he spoke! In my couple of hours there I heard him speak Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and English! I don’t know the extent of his fluency in each but I will say as an oft solo traveler finding a friendly face who even tries to speak my language when I’m obviously struggling to read menus or order is such a God send and immediately makes me comfortable. Overall the food was great, the Sangria top notch but it was the service that really sold me on the tapas place. I really hope I have some time to stop by again before my trip ends but I will be sure to come back the next time in Barcelona!   \n",

It's gotten a little touristy, but with patience you can find a table or a spot at the bar. You won't be disappointed by the quality, the variety and the prices of the tapas (i recommend shrimps). Also the sandwiches are really good.   \n",

HOWEVER, this is a tourist trap, with the worst service ever. First of all, the server acted like he didn't even want to be here. Second of all, he had ZERO knowledge about hygiene and food safety. When he brought out the first tapa ( mushrooms w egg yolk ), his thumb was touching the rim of the plate and nail was touching the mushroom. By the third tapa, he looked at me as his thumb touched the tomato bread. And he handed me a new plate with grease on it. Thinking about all the germs he had in his nails... YUCK.   \n",

The choice is enormous, every bite is heaven. And many people know this, and that is why this place during dinner times is absolutely loaded. The first time I had to come back for a table at 23:30 (thank god Barcelona had crazy dinner times). Normally between 16-17 in the afternoon you can find a place at the bar. Anyway, when in Barcelona, don't miss this place.   \n",

Some dishes better than others. Very friendly service. Worth booking places in advance as there is a long line. We sat outside but it seems that the better atmosphere is inside... we could not wait for our turn :(...   \n",

So after a long trip and an afternoon nap, this place was a great to taste several tapas, beer and wine. The razor clams are great among the other 10 tapas we tried. The nata dessert was also excellent and the service was great.    \n",

Too bad we only went there on our last night in town. Good food, great service staff. They were lively and made good recommendation for us to try. Service was quick too and we didnt have to wait long for food. However, this place is popular so go early if you want a good table. we sat outside in the cold, which was fine. Overall love this place. will be back   \n",

Thursday evening around six we were able to get a table immediately. Our server, Raquel, was very helpful explaining the differences between the tapas and mondtiditos. We ordered several items including sardines, crispy eggplant, mushrooms with asparagus codfish fritters and enjoyed everything. Two nites later we returned and Raquel remembered us. This time we tried garlic shrimp and a fried platter of squid, sardines and cuttlefish with mini poblanos plus a couple of “old favorites and a pitcher of sangria. Second dinner was even better and we then took Raquel’s dessert recommendation of bread pudding which is more of a soufflé with a creamy interior—scrumptious! Prices are very reasonable, service is quick and they are open from 9:30am to 1:30 am. If we return to Barcelona, we will return to Catalana   \n",

You can’t make a reservation, but if you eat around 6:30-7:00 you shouldn’t have much of a wait. When we left at 9:30, the line was out the door. They have a regular menu and a specials menu. A couple of dishes we wanted from the specials menu were already sold out. We loved the razor clams, the burrata salad and the ham and cheese mini sandwich the best, but everything we tried was good. Make sure to save room for the burnt St Joan bread pudding. Service was friendly and very efficient. We would definitely return.   \n",
