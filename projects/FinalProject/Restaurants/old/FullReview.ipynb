       "      <td>I was recommended this place for Tapas during TripAdvisor search. They don't do reservations but there is a waiting list outside. First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.</td>\n",

The garlic prawns with tomato bread were the best! I also had some ham/cheese tapas, a beer and finished with some churos. It was 25 euros so well worth it. Would definitely go back! The inside is more bright and modern than I was expecting but it had a nice atmosphere and great food.  \n",

High quality small dishes, with a very wide offer. It is always full, you need to queue. Go with plenty of time. The atmosphere is great, service is fast and prices are reasonable. You can have a taste of the local cuisine with several small dishes. You will not go there only once.  \n",

Food comes very quickly, best to not order too much at the same time. Staff is friendly, however can appear a bit rushed as this place seems to have a waiting line outside most of the time. But really a must-try!  \n",

       "13  I was recommended this place for Tapas during TripAdvisor search. They don't do reservations but there is a waiting list outside. First time was unlucky for me as I went late and there was wait for about an hour, I had to reach somewhere so I quit. The mesmerizing view of tapas served at outside tables as I left made me even more curious to try this place, so I visited again. Next time I went earlier, there was still a wait but I was able to be seated by Mawel at reception who apologized to me for not getting table last time. I was seated by her at a table at end of the dining hall. A friendly and very attending server took my order and gave me wonderful suggestions. A lovely American couple sitting on next table also joined the Tapas discussion and added some advise. So with double help, I ordered Shrimps al ajillo with tomato bread on suggestion of server to dip the bread in shrimp sauce. I also ordered Tapa de Mercado on suggestion of the American friends which was an Entrecote steak. For drinks I ordered a glass of beer with Shrimps and Tinto de Verano (Summer Red) drink with the steak. My order was delivered in time despite the packed restaurant. Its hard to keep quality high at such a busy place which doesn't take reservations but I have to say they nailed every dish. My shrimps were perfectly cooked and the sauce was heavenly. Trying it with bread as suggested by the server was perfect idea which took me to taste heaven. Entrecote steak was perfectly medium as I like and flawlessly seasoned. Tinto de Verano doubled the taste of steak. I asked the couple about their experience and they were equally impressed. I chatted a bit with the staff and my newly made friends, then I asked for the check. It all cost me 28.10 euros only for all the taste and fun. This is called real class, you get a customer base yet keep prices very reasonable. I thanked the server and Mawel while leaving with so much satisfaction.If you want to start your Tapa experience while in Barcelona or just want to taste the real deal, just go to Cerveceria Catalana. Its worth the wait for quality and service. Very highly recommended.  \n",

Great place for tourists with a huge variety in the menu and high quality of food & drinks. It’s a most in Barcelona!  \n",

They were very disorganized and look lost and desperate while taking care the long waiting line.The food is good but you can find other places better than this one in barcelona. I hope they can improve their service because the place is very nice.  \n",

The is absolutely the best tapas restaurant in Barcelona. The food is fantastic, the drinks and wine very good, and the overall experience is definitely value-for-money. The staff is very friendly and service minded. Its not possible to book a table, so I recommend come early or be prepared to wait for a while to be seated. Great Experience!  \n",

After all the waiting the waiter started to tell us off. What? Definitely not recommended. The system of listing people outside is a mess. They don’t do reservations and everyone is packed in the front of the restaurant. And the employees tell you off. Poor service.  \n",
